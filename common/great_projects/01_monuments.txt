### MONUMENTY SĄ NA STAN Z 01.01.1975 ROKU AKA ZAPAŚĆ GIERKOWSKA

#Posortowane względem Excela z podziałem na województwa, w przypadku dużych aglomeracji które zostały podzielone 
#zostanie zadysponowana osobna kategoria (podobno jakiś czarnuch z excela ma zrobić tabelkę do tego)

#ZAKAZ WRZUCANIA WIĘCEJ NIŻ 6 MONUMENTÓW W MIASTO (balans?)

#Województwa bez monumentów: none
#Miasta bez monumentów: Lublin, Rzeszów, i w sumie inne mniejsze gówno idk w DLC się dorobi

#PS W przyszłości jak będzie klarowniejsza sytuacja nawrzucać blokady pokroju "can_build_in_age_of_communism = no"
