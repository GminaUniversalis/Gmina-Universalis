### Gmina Universalis

What is Gmina Universalis?

To put it straight, it is, or it's supposed to be a total overhaul mod taking place in glorious meme country of Poland, where Gmina act's as provinces, Powiat as countries, and religions were converted to political parties.

What are Gmina and Powiat you might ask? 
It's administrative division of Poland. Usually Powiat consists of around 5 Gmina's with some exceptions, but you will get the idea.

Due to the dire need to adapt the game mechanics to the Polish reality, many things had to be changed and the timeline was slightly "bent".

The planned game start by reality and "lore" is in 1969, during the deep and dark communist period, where most of the country is controlled by the PZPR (Polish United Workers Party) , and through the centuries it lasts more or less until the present day. The timeline was "bent" due to stretching over 50 years of Polish history into 377 years of the game, compromises had to be made in some places, BUT

This is not a historical mod.


It will include all the things that define our cardboard country, what it is and what it consists of, whether it be things from now, 10 years, 50 years or 300 years ago, it doesn't matter, just everything.

My main idea was that when you choose your Gmina or Powiat to play, you will find something familiar there, whether it be a monument, a mission tree, some modifier or a description in the idea referring to some local memes.

I just want it to be a mod where you can choose any country, conquer the poland in "what if" scenario, have fun with your friends in multiplayer and just have a good time playing without sweating.
