### Gmina Universalis

Hello there english-speaking folks. This is Gmina Universalis, total conversion mod about your favourite meme country of Poland.
Main premise of this mod is that it's created, based on Poland's smallest administrative subdivision, which is called "Gmina"

This mod is currently in unplayable state and I have no clue why it is on main workshop page

TODO LIST:
- Every 'Powiat' (which is tier higher in terms of adm subdivisions than 'Gmina') will be made into country (380)
- Formable 'Wojewodztwa' (which is highest tier in terms of adm subdivisions, above 'Powiat', 16 of them)
- Bigger rivers will be navigable, like in CK2
-Monuments in every major city, with their most recognizable landmarks
- Cultures based on polish dialects

Potential submods:
- Religions as political parties, we have some own circus over there
- Major cities, will be made into a separate locations, accesible via main provinces, with their districts as provinces
