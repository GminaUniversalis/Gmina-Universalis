 Ciupaska_soldiers_desc:0 "In the mountainous regions of Ma³opolska, mysterious creatures called "Górale" reside. Apart from tricking tourists into spending large sums of money, making oscypek cheese, and saying "Hey" at every opportunity, they also love to have children. The natural increase in population in these areas is significant enough that surplus children are often abandoned in ditches and along roadsides, from where they can be easily taken. Our recruiters eagerly take advantage of this opportunity, turning these abducted tykes into professional soldiers."

In their eyes, we are seen as a weak region, full of girls with braids and without braids, or femboys. Nevertheless, we have learned to use this fact to our advantage, making our conquests appear less threatening, as they are carried out by the "cuttie Lesserpoland"

However, it is certain that the first monument of the pope to Ma³opolska was dedicated and brought by the pope himself. The residents quickly began to imitate the successor of Saint Peter in this matter; monuments of the pope stand in every vacant space, and new ones are constantly being erected. However, there is a positive aspect to this: the awareness that one is constantly being observed by John Paul II (even if it is a pope made of wood or concrete) discourages people from excesses and dangerous behavior."
