 flavor_mng.30.t:0 "Keju"
 flavor_mng.30.d:0 "Careful selection of bureaucrats and administrators is a vital process for an empire with our size. To sate our need for capable and shrewd individuals, we have refined the imperial examination system - also known as Keju - to suit the needs of our dynasty. The exams are a certain path to ensuring all our bureaucrats are familiar with writing etiquette, Chinese literary classics and various styles among state officials. This shared conduct will serve to cement our nation and promote unity, as well as the promotion of the meritocratic ideal that outlines the cornerstones of the founding of our dynasty. The examination system will therefore go on to play a significant role in tempering the power of hereditary aristocracy and military authority, and in the rise of a gentry class of scholar-bureaucrats."

 flavor_mng.33.d:1 "One of the largest lineages within the Kagyu school and one of the four major schools of thought that follow Tibetan Buddhism, the Karma Kagyu play a profound role in the internal politics between the slopes of the mountains of our homeland.

 flavor_mng.35.t:0 "Yellow River Dikes"
 flavor_mng.35.d:0 "Along the Grand Canals that maintain the flow of life-precious water across the heart of our realm, dikes across the Yellow River may assist our farmers and prospecting merchants in harnessing the tide and power of one of nature's elements. Given that rivers in China have an unpredictable nature, we would best be on guard for future floods and try to mitigate these disasters by maintaining our dikes."
 flavor_mng.35.a:0 "Time and tide wait for no man!"
 
 flavor_mng.36.t:0 "The Great Tax Reform"
 flavor_mng.36.d:0 "For centuries, tax collection was a daily nightmare for our provincial governors and administrators. However, recent advancements in bureaucratic efficiency have paved the way for us to introduce a nation-wide tax reform based entirely on silver. Despite advocates who signaled trouble ahead due to overreliance on precious metals, this policy may prove pivotal for our prosperity."

 flavor_mng.39.t:0 "Diplomacy with the Emperor of China"
 flavor_mng.39.d:0 "Our relationship with the Emperors of China has not always been stable. However, a good administrator and diplomat may know when to bow their head so as to not lose it. To that end, we have recently greeted a delegation of the Chinese Emperor within our court, demanding our subjugation to the superiority as dictated by the Heavens themselves."
 flavor_mng.39.a:0 "We gladly accept."
 flavor_mng.39.b:0 "Never!"
 
 flavor_mng.40.t:0 "The Eastern and Western Bureaus"
 flavor_mng.40.d:0 "Powerful imperial bodies have always orchestrated and commanded influence and power in palatial affairs.

The fruits of our conquests are ample, granting us access to the imperial treasury and in turn utilizing it to further the prosperity of our people. However, cracks are beginning to show across our vast realm. Our inability to properly delegate our authority within our provinces, coupled with the rise of neighboring threats to the North and the incapability of our current Emperor are some of the alarming signs during our times. We must reform our government, maintain Heaven's favor and ensure the continuation of our dynasty as the eternal rulers of China."
 flavor_mng.42.a:0 "The Heavens are testing our great Empire..."
 
 flavor_mng.43.t:0 "Governmental Purges in the Empire of China"
 flavor_mng.43.d:0 "The cycle of life and death is true for all things, including bureaucracy. For far too long elements within our government have enjoyed the Emperor's favor and wealth, enriching themselves and spreading their corruption upon anything they touch. We would best limit and crack down on these rogue bureaucrats lest their influence grows too large!"

In order to shape our administration and make legislative proclamation, our monarchs frequently use grand pronouncements.

 flavor_mng.45.t:0 "Expanding the Jinyiwei"
 flavor_mng.45.d:1 "Also known as the Embroidered Uniform Guard, the Jinyiwei serve as the pure expression of law and order within the empire. Being the Emperor's secret police, their authority is even above all other forms of the judiciary system. They can arrest and punish anyone them deem an enemy of the state, and not even high ranking nobles or the relatives of the Emperor themselves are out of their reach.

As a result of this, the Shi'ite Turks living in Asia Minor were beginning to get deported into the region of Morea. The Safavid Qizilbash made their way into Kurdistan, defeating the local Turkish Garrisons while being heavily outnumbered.

Naturally, this claim of Roman succession was also used by Mehmed to justify an invasion of Otranto in 1480 with the further ambition to conquer Rome for the Ottomans.

This emphasis on militarization helped Prussia become one of the strongest powers in Europe and allowed it to successfully defend itself against its enemies and expand its territories. The Prussian army became a model for other European powers, and its tactics and organizational structure were widely imitated. As a result, militarization was a key factor in the rise of Prussia as a great power during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n "
