However, due to the communist system in place at that time, the volume of furniture sold was never very high, and the network itself could not conduct trade in Poland. The collapse of the centrally planned economy system and Poland's opening up to the world led to the Swedish brand opening its first store, with rumors suggesting it won't be the last retail outlet belonging to the Scandinavian giant. Additionally, more and more orders from Swedes are flowing to Polish factories, positively impacting not only the furniture industry but also the related timber industry.

However, right from the start, it faced many problems - the degradation of fishing grounds forced the company to purchase expensive licenses, the increasingly outdated and shrinking fishing fleet struggled more and more poorly on the wide expanses of the ocean, and on top of that, there was the classic management style of the PRL (Polish People's Republic). It's not surprising, therefore, that in the conditions of a market economy, cut off from public funds, "Gryf" was heading towards collapse. This is happening right now, but despite its weak position, "Gryf" still accounts for a large supply of fish in Poland.
