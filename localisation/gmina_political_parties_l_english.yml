He has mastered to perfection the manipulation of people, ergo: voters, and does not hesitate to take risky actions to gain high office. In doing so, he tries to make the best possible impression, so he takes care of his outward appearance by, among other things, covering his severely balding forehead with a toupee."

He believes that a doctor and a pharmacist are a mission - except that a pharmacist should not be a doctor. When the Senator offers Magister a place on the parliamentary election list, the Senator's wife fears that Magister will reject the offers. She goes to him to convince him to change his mind so that her lover will pursue a political career. After the PPU's success in the parliamentary elections, Ryszard is offered a good position in the Ministry of Health, but the pharmacist refuses, explaining that the very idea of being an MP scares him."
