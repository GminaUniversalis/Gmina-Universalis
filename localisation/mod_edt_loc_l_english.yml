 aow_events.1.t: "The Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 aow_events.1.d: "All of [Root.Owner.GetName] suffers in war, but those provinces which lie in the path of the enemy suffer worst. What appears to a soldier or commander as a convenient source of supplies is often all the common people have. The outskirts of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been plundered in this war to the point of starvation. They are now reaching out for the government to aid them in recovering, lest the suffering of [Root.Owner.GetName] drag on for years past the eventual peace."
 aow_events.1.a: "Whatever is necessary, we will provide."
 aow_events.1.b: "That money is better spent winning this war."
 aow_events.2.t: "Skirting the Borders"
 aow_events.2.d: "Sieges can be costly both in time and lives, and we normally take whatever measures necessary to finish them quickly. A siege in the ongoing war has happened to occur close to the border, sparking a discussion about how far the soldiers should go in raiding the countryside.\n\nThe nation on the other side is not our enemy in this war, but perhaps if some of their hamlets were raided, seemingly by mistake, they would understand. The siege could be greatly aided by these supplies."
 aow_events.2.a: "Go as far as you need to resupply, and finish this."
 aow_events.2.a.tt: "[This.Owner.GetName] may not be pleased with us..."
 aow_events.2.b: "I'd be wiser to let this conflict remain within the borders of our enemies."
 aow_events.3.t: "[From.GetName] Assaulting our Borders"
 aow_events.3.d: "Despite our nations being at peace, we've received reports of [From.GetAdjective] soldiers attacking our borders in [Root.GetName], assaulting peasants to resupply. Their ambassadors assure us that this is a simple mistake and that the army has grown a bit desperate in maintaining supplies for an ongoing siege across the border. Mistake or not, [Root.GetName] has suffered for it."
 aow_events.3.a: "This is an unacceptable violation of our borders!"
 aow_events.3.b: "We can all make mistakes in times of war. An apology is enough."
 aow_events.4.t: "Resistance"
 aow_events.4.d: "Commoners and nobles may not always be satisfied with our rule, but they are even less pleased with foreign occupation of their land. Despite the province being under enemy control, a resistance movement has grown in [Root.GetName], ready to strike against the invaders and reclaim the land for their cause. Their leader has come to us for aid, promising that if we bring the weapons, they can bring the fire."

 aow_events.4.b: "If they want to support [Root.Owner.GetName], they should work with our armed forces."
 aow_events.5.t: "Plague at the Siege of [Root.GetName]"
 aow_events.5.d: "Where war goes, go pestilence, famine and death. Our armies at [Root.GetName] have held the fort against the besieging forces of our enemies, but both sides have seen the arrival of a terrible disease in the province, endangering civilians as well as soldiers. To spare the locals a worse epidemic, at least one side would need to evacuate some of its people. Unless the attackers show the same caution, however, they may take this opportunity to advance their siege."
 aow_events.5.a: "Very well, we must think of the people."
 aow_events.5.a.tt: "If our enemies stay, they may take advantage of this to gain the upper hand in the siege."

 aow_events.6.d: "Where war goes, go pestilence, famine and death. [From.Owner.GetAdjective] troops at [From.GetName] have held the fort against our besieging forces, but both sides have seen the arrival of a terrible disease in the province, endangering civilians as well as soldiers. To spare the locals and our own soldiers a worse epidemic, at least one side would need to evacuate some of its people. Unless the defenders show the same caution, however, they may take this opportunity to cause a setback to our siege."
 aow_events.6.a: "We can't afford to have this crisis get worse."

 aow_events.7.a: "An opportunity we will certainly take."
 aow_events.8.t: "Attackers Evacuate Siege"

 aow_events.8.a: "May they never falter."
 aow_events.9.t: "Plague in [Root.GetName] Grows Worse"
 aow_events.9.d: "Despite the plague sweeping the war-torn land, both our valiant defending forces and the ceaseless attackers laying siege to our fortress in [Root.GetName] refused to back down. The mutual stubbornness has caused major losses for the civilian population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], who now see their home city destroyed both by war and plague."
 aow_events.9.a: "We were both fools..."
 aow_events.10.t: "Plague in [From.GetName] Grows Worse"
 aow_events.10.d: "Despite the plague sweeping the war-torn land, both the relentless defending forces and our daring attackers laying siege to their fortress in [From.GetName] refused to back down. The mutual stubbornness has caused major losses for the civilian population of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName], tearing down the infrastructure and making the siege even more difficult."
 aow_events.10.a.tt: "The plague will linger for years in [This.GetName], increasing attrition for foreign troops and harming its inhabitants."
 aow_events.11.t: "Spread of Pestilence"
 aow_events.11.d: "The war has worsened the spread of diseases, and what once started as a local epidemic centered around a siege has now spread further. Dislocated civilians as well as troop movements, both difficult to avoid in wartime, has facilitated this and now [Root.GetName] has also fallen victim to the illness."
 aow_events.11.a: "Curse this war..."
 aow_events.12.t: "Cruelty of Mercenaries"
 aow_events.12.d: "War is seldom without brutality. Soldiers are not known for their mercy, but this war has seen some exceptionally vile behavior on the part of our occupying forces. It appears that the [hired_mercenary_band.GetName], the mercenary band we have sent to occupy [war_province.GetAreaName], are unsatisfied with the wages we provide them and have resorted to robbing the civilian population. Their actions have tainted the image of all our troops. As extortion by means of terror and torture becomes commonplace, [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers are reviled as well as feared and stories of their atrocities spread well beyond the borders of the war."
 aow_events.12.a: "We should prevent this from happening in the future."
 aow_events.12.b: "Bellum se ipsum alet! Let them take what they want."
 aow_events.13.t: "Mercenary Bands Raid [Root.GetAreaName]"
 aow_events.13.d: "The enemy occupation of [Root.GetAreaName] has come at a great cost for its people. Driven by a mixture of greed and desperation, the [hired_mercenary_band.GetName], a mercenary band hired by [From.GetUsableName], has violently plundered and terrorized local civilians in an attempt to extort money and resources."
 aow_events.13.a: "Greed corrupts men's hearts..."
 aow_events.14.t: "Displaced Refugees from [Root.GetName]"
 aow_events.14.d: "The lingering effects of the war still plague [Root.Owner.GetName]. Some areas have been destroyed to the point of becoming nearly uninhabitable, and people have been forced to move around to survive under these conditions. Some people have left [Root.GetName] entirely, settling in neighboring provinces where the war has left fewer scars."
 aow_events.14.a: "The war may be over, but our troubles are not."
 aow_events.15.t: "The Families Left Behind"
 aow_events.15.d: "The recent war took a heavy toll on our people. Many were called, few returned. The families of nobles and commoners alike toiled as they waited for soldiers to return home, but the war ended and they never did. Now the toiling continues, many being so preoccupied with the work to make up for the lost pair of hands that they barely have time to grieve. Of the ones who have time to think, many are increasingly thinking that we have been throwing away lives too carelessly."
 aow_events.15.a: "We can ease the tax burden on the bereaved."
 aow_events.15.b: "Let us be more lenient drafting for the army in the future."
 aow_events.15.c: "This is the price that must be paid for our glorious nation."
 aow_events.16.t: "Witchcraft"
 aow_events.16.d: "The people of the war-torn city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are looking for reasons for the misfortunes that have befallen them. Fortunately, they have not found them to be related to our rulership, but unfortunately, what they have found has caused quite a stir. The prolonged effects of the war and how they seem to affect some more than others, they claim, can only be the work of those practicing witchcraft and sorcery.\n\nAccusations have been leveled generously, and there are local authorities willing to organize proper trials for these crimes. As proper as trials for magic get in [Root.GetName], anyway."
 aow_events.16.a: "Allow them to proceed with the local trials."
 aow_events.16.b: "$INQUISITOR$ can see to these matters in a more organized fashion."
 aow_events.16.c: "Such foolish superstitions have no place in [Root.Owner.GetName]!"
 aow_events.17.t: "Witch-hunt"
 aow_events.17.d: "Since the long-suffering people in [Root.GetName] received the blessing of the state and church to prosecute those who allegedly brought famine and disease upon them by means of witchcraft, they have made good use of it. While once only the obviously suspicious were pointed out, witches now appear to be everywhere. The crowd calls for the spilling of peasant and noble blood alike, and even some of the local clergy may not be trustworthy.\n\nThis abundance of satanic practices certainly goes a long way to explain the post-war hardships of [Root.GetName], but the mass trials that have followed are going out of hand. We might consider the possibility that some are innocent."
 aow_events.17.a: "Cease this madness!"
 aow_events.17.b: "Intervene on behalf of the nobles."
 aow_events.17.c: "Intervene on behalf of the commoners."
 aow_events.17.e: "Let them exact justice as they see fit."
 aow_events.18.t: "A Witch from Foreign Lands"
 aow_events.18.d: "Being able to recognize witches and sorcerers with certainty is a rare gift, which we do not know on whom God will bestow. Fortunately, being able to recognize them with uncertainty based on strange or unusual behavior or successes is a very common gift with the added benefit of more consistently targeting people who are somewhat maladjusted.\n\nSometimes, however, it can be inconvenient. Locals in [Root.GetName] have recently pointed out a [they_send_us_witches.GetAdjective] noblewoman as a witch. Prosecuting her might cause a diplomatic incident, but not intervening might be seen as a sign of lacking faith."
 aow_events.18.a: "This fear of the unfamiliar must be stopped."
 aow_events.18.b: "Witches, spies, who know what they're up to?"
 aow_events.19.t: "A Highly Troubling Accusation"
 aow_events.19.d: "Under the watchful eye of $INQUISITOR$, trials for sorcery and heresy have proceeded under relatively controlled circumstances. $INQUISITOR_CAP_ADJ$ would not be at our court if we did not trust $INQUISITOR_O_PRONOUN$, after all. A recent event has complicated this, however, as $INQUISITOR_ADJ$ has challenged our trust of another. $STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$, who has aided [Root.GetName] greatly in foreign relations, has been accused of witchcraft, a testament to no one being truly unquestionable.\n\n$STATESMAN$$TRADER$$SPYMASTER$$DIPLOMAT$ claims that $INQUISITOR$ is supporting these accusations out of pure jealousy. Political drama may be behind all this, but then again, we have trusted our inquisitor so far."
 aow_events.19.a: "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
 aow_events.19.b: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
 aow_events.20.t: "The Fires of Hell"
 aow_events.20.d: "$INQUISITOR$ has been diligent. With the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s support, those who practice witchcraft are condemned and burned, on Earth as it is in Hell. Our merciless prosecution of these crimes has put our religious devotion beyond reproach.\n\nStill, there are moments of doubt. One day, your young heir [Root.Heir.GetName] watches the public execution of a witch for the first time. You see [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] eyes fill up with terror in the firelight, and before it's through, your child is begging for the witch to be spared. Your attempts to explain do nothing to stop the tears, and eventually you find yourself at a loss to justify this to an innocent mind. Perhaps the convicted is innocent too, and you will once burn yourself, eternally."
 aow_events.20.a: "The child is right. We have been blinded by our zeal."
 aow_events.20.b: "Hush child, and hope no one heard that..."
 aow_events.21.t: "Unknown Shooter"
 aow_events.21.d: "[Root.GetName] has a recent history of war, and the [Root.GetAdjective] people increasingly doubt its purposes, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] persists in leading the army ever forward. The soldiers are weary, with many wishing to return home. We have never had reason to consider how badly.\n\nUntil this day. While the troops prepared to face the enemy, a shot rang out, and the king fell to the ground, dead. An enemy sharpshooter? A plot by claimants for the throne? Or maybe this was just how badly someone wanted to leave all this behind."
 aow_events.21.a: "We may never know."
 aow_events.22.t: "A Change of Character"
 aow_events.22.d: "After the war ended, our ardent diplomatic advisor $DIPLOMAT$ has repeatedly implored [Root.Monarch.GetName] not only to shift foreign policy to avoid future bloodshed, but even suggested that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should change [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] priorities as a ruler.\n\n'As long as the people see their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] preparing for war, how can they do anything but blame us when war is upon them?' $DIPLOMAT$ asks. 'It is not merely what the people want. It is what this nation needs.'"
 aow_events.22.a: "You are right, [Root.GetName] needs peace."
 aow_events.22.b: "Forsake the spirit that called me to war? Ridiculous."
 aow_events.23.t: "The Faithful in Enemy Lands"
 aow_events.23.d: "Many soldiers see our ongoing war as a conflict of faiths. This has led to some debate around one of our ongoing sieges, where the local population are [Root.Religion.GetName]. Normally, our troops would supply the siege by taking what we need from the locals, but the pious in our army think we should spare our [Root.Religion.GetName] brothers and sisters, even at the cost of the siege dragging out for longer. Which comes first among the [Root.GetAdjective] people, faith or war?"
 aow_events.23.a: "Spare the faithful."
 aow_events.23.b: "No mercy for enemies of [Root.GetName]!"
 aow_events.24.t: "[Root.GetName] Betrayed by Brothers in Faith"
 aow_events.24.d: "When the [Root.Religion.GetName] fools of [Root.GetName] were first attacked by our enemies, they shared their faith, despite our best efforts to make them see the light. Now, having suffered the brutal onslaught of the war, they have seen just how shallow the morality of the [Root.Religion.GetName] really is. After being besieged and raided by the people they trusted, they have bitterly thrown aside their old beliefs, and swore allegiance not only to our country, but to our religion."
 aow_events.24.a: "We will show them the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith has more integrity than that."
 aow_events.25.t: "Unbelievers in [Root.GetName] Waver"
 aow_events.25.d: "While most of our nation fears the [Root.Religion.GetName] invaders, a few citizens seem to welcome them. After [Root.GetName] fell to the enemy, its inhabitants seem to have started considering if they'd be better off in a country headed by rulers of their own faith. In an effort of mitigate this betrayal, the local rulers have sent a messenger to our court, requesting promises of a more hands-off approach to religious matters in [Root.GetName]. Otherwise, the enemy may already have a hold on the province."
 aow_events.25.a: "We will reward loyalty with respect."
 aow_events.25.b: "We will not accept disloyalty."
 aow_events.26.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Defectors"
 aow_events.26.d: "The wise and spiritually enlightened people of [From.GetName] have found, after we occupied their land, that they might benefit from joining us. After all, [From.Owner.GetName] is a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] country, with little understanding of their ways. If the war goes well, this will certainly help."
 aow_events.26.a: "We may be able to accommodate them..."
 aow_events.27.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Betrayal in [Root.GetName]!"
 aow_events.27.d: "Our war against the [Root.Religion.GetName] has not gone unnoticed by their local supporters. In [Root.GetName], traitors who hold faith before country have taken the opportunity to rise up and attack us, perhaps hoping to aid the enemy or encourage other [Root.Religion.GetName] nations to join the war."
 aow_events.27.a: "Faith determines the path of all, even the wicked."
 aow_events.28.t: "Struggle Without, Struggle Within"
 aow_events.28.d: "Sometimes, we see conflicts on the international stage mirrored within our own borders. Today, we received news that our war with [Root.Religion.GetName] nations has brought about a religious conflict in [Root.GetName], where the [Root.Religion.GetName] and [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faiths exist side by side. People who used to be neighbors and friends are attacking each other over what they perceive as the differences between us and our adversaries."
 aow_events.28.a: "Like the war, this conflict must take its course."
 aow_events.28.b: "Unite against the true enemy! You are all [Root.Owner.GetAdjective]!"
 aow_events.29.t: "Country Before Faith"
 aow_events.29.d: "Our relation to the religious dissidents in [Root.GetName] has varied, but at least some of the local [Root.Religion.GetName] citizens seem to appreciate our leadership. 'Seem to' may be a key phrase in the situation, because they have recently approached us with an offer to use their religious ties in one of our rival countries to strengthen our international spy network. Provided that they can be relied upon, they could provide a rare and valuable asset..."
 aow_events.29.a: "We will trust them to remain loyal to us."
 aow_events.29.b: "There is no need for such underhanded tactics... or risks."
 aow_events.30.t: "Warriors of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Faith"
 aow_events.30.d: "The more zealous among the [Root.Religion.GetName] of [Root.GetName] have long kept watch at the border, suspicious of the motives of the unbelievers on the other side. Now, they find their suspicions confirmed by the open declaration of war. Prepared and willing to give their lives for the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause, their local militia has joined our forces in the battle against the invading army."
 aow_events.30.a: "Forward, sentinels of the truth!"
 aow_events.31.t: "Early Reformers"
 aow_events.31.d: "When news of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith spread to our land, we were among the first to accept it. We know where the future of the Christian faith lies and while less enlightened nations may take their time to get there and need to be dragged along, we march proudly towards it.\n\nFortunately, we are not surrounded by these fools on all sides. The rulers of a neighboring country have taken the same admirable path, freeing themselves from the clutches of the Pope and educating themselves in [Root.Religion.GetName] theology. The Church of [Root.GetName] may hold the foremost scholars, but there may yet be much to learn from others."
 aow_events.31.a: "Together we will spread God's true message!"
 aow_events.31.b: "The Church of [Root.GetName] stands alone."
 aow_events.32.t: "Neither [Root.Religion.GetName] nor Catholic"
 aow_events.32.d: "[Root.Religion.GetName] preachers are not the only ones to stand up against the Catholic Church. Scholars from different movements are questioning their corrupt doctrine, perhaps not in perfect tune with our own criticism, but nevertheless highly relevant. One of our neighboring nations is home to one such movement. In these tumultuous times, can we really afford to quibble over theological disagreements when we could work together? It could benefit us, if they show the same open-mindedness."
 aow_events.32.a: "We will stand with them against the Pope, if they stand with us."
 aow_events.32.b: "They spread lies, merely different lies."
 aow_events.33.t: "[From.Religion.GetName] Neighbors Reach Out"
 aow_events.33.d: "The Church of [From.GetName] is far from being in full agreement with the Church of [Root.GetName] in many spiritual matters, but in one worldly matter we agree"
 aow_events.33.a: "Together, we can return Christianity to what it was meant to be."
 aow_events.33.b: "The last thing we need is theological confusion in our own ranks."
 aow_events.34.t: "[From.Religion.GetName] Neighbors Accept"
 aow_events.34.d: "Our generous gesture towards [From.GetName] has paid off. Despite our differences, their [From.Religion.GetName] leaders have conceded that we, as the vanguard of the Reformation, should attempt to unite our causes for the greater good."
 aow_events.34.a: "The pious of [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] will remember this day."
 aow_events.35.t: "[From.Religion.GetName] Neighbors Reject Our Charity"
 aow_events.35.d: "The foolishly dogmatic Church of [From.GetName] are apparently too set in their ways to do diplomacy with those who try to aid them. Maybe our [Root.Religion.GetName] ways seem just as misguided to them as the policies of the Holy See."
 aow_events.35.a: "Do they not know to love their neighbor as themselves?"
 aow_events.36.t: "Heretics Encroach On Our Land"
 aow_events.36.d: "While we have worked hard to root out the heretical confusion that seeks to undermine the Christian faith, just across our borders, a nation has embraced it. Perhaps they think we've failed to notice that they have allowed those who reject the Catholic Church to set the agenda in their capital, spreading their lies rapidly from it. Perhaps they think we've failed to notice that our own country has seen provinces turned from the true faith. Have we?"
 aow_events.36.a: "No, we can see all too well what must be done."
 aow_events.36.b: "We can certainly pretend to."
 aow_events.37.t: "The Cause of the Protestant Plague"
 aow_events.37.d: "Normally, each nation's rabble is their own concern. Not so when another nation openly espouses the same spiritual rot as the rabble. Many among both the clergy and military draw a straight line between the Protestant revolters we fight today and the dedication to the Protestant cause shown by our neighbors. We cannot remain a respected and feared nation in the eyes of others if we do not confront them about their support, explicit or implicit, of the heretics who assault the [Root.GetAdjective] lands."
 aow_events.37.a: "They better have an answer for us!"
 aow_events.37.b: "Let us not stir up more trouble over this."
 aow_events.38.t: "The Cause of the Calvinist Plague"
 aow_events.38.d: "Normally, each nation's rabble is their own concern. Not so when another nation openly espouses the same spiritual rot as the rabble. Many among both the clergy and military draw a straight line between the Reformed revolters we fight today and the dedication to the Reformed cause shown by our neighbors. We cannot remain a respected and feared nation in the eyes of others if we do not confront them about their support, explicit or implicit, of the heretics who assault the [Root.GetAdjective] lands."
 aow_events.38.a: "They better have an answer for us!"
 aow_events.38.b: "Let us not stir up more trouble over this."
 aow_events.39.t: "[From.GetName] Confronts Us About Rebels"
 aow_events.39.d: "Apparently, the [From.GetAdjective] government's decision to enforce the Catholic faith in their lands has been a mistake in more ways than one. Their [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects have revolted against them, which more than a few of those affected blame on our support of the true faith.\n\nNow, an ambassador from [From.GetName] has openly confronted us about this issue, and rather imperiously demanded that we renounce the rebels and their struggle. While we certainly would like to see the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, this is a diplomatic issue more than a religious one. What is our stance on these foreign rebels?"
 aow_events.39.a: "Cuius regio, eius religio. They should respect the will of their rulers."
 aow_events.39.b: "We demand that you cease your oppression of these poor [Root.Religion.GetName] subjects!"
 aow_events.39.c: "We will support the faithful against you, openly and gladly!"
 aow_events.40.t: "[From.GetName] Renounces [From.Religion.GetName] Rebels"
 aow_events.40.d: "Whatever troubles we may have with the [From.Religion.GetName] scum within our own borders, we can console ourselves with the fact that the international leaders of their faith distance themselves from this rebellion. [From.GetName] have promised us that regardless of their own beliefs, they consider the revolt against our rule unacceptable."
 aow_events.40.a: "Let us hope this is not just duplicitous talk."
 aow_events.41.t: "[From.GetName] Defend [From.Religion.GetName] Rebels"
 aow_events.41.d: "Apparently the [From.Religion.GetName] in [From.GetName] are more brazen about the trouble they cause than we thought. When confronted about the fact that their brothers and sisters in faith are rioting in our streets, their response was that we brought this upon ourselves by disrespecting their heretical beliefs."
 aow_events.41.a: "If that's how they see things, they can hardly hope to retain our respect."
 aow_events.42.t: "[From.GetName] Funds [From.Religion.GetName] Rebels!"
 aow_events.42.d: "Our efforts to get [From.GetName] to take responsibility for the heresy they spread seem to have backfired. Not only have they embraced the rebel movement against our state religion, they have openly incited more riots, causing the heretics to grow even more confident in their cause. Every drop of Catholic blood spilled on our soil by these maniacs is now on their hands."
 aow_events.42.a: "There can be no absolution for those who persist in sin."
 aow_events.43.t: "Cardinal Across the Border"
 aow_events.43.d: "Sometimes, we have the chance to set something into motion without seeming to have done anything. One such chance has arrived recently, when a cardinal living in [send_cardinal_province.GetName] admitted to an agent from [Root.GetName] that he would consider moving across the border to [receive_cardinal_province.GetName] and support us in the Curia for a price. While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this"
 aow_events.43.a: "We will take our chances that they never find out."
 aow_events.43.b: "It is not worth risking, but the man who found him deserves a promotion."
 aow_events.44.t: "Cardinal Bribed to Move"
 aow_events.44.d: "A cardinal who had previously stayed in [Root.GetName], close to the border, has now moved out of our nation entirely and shifted his allegiance to our neighbors. The [From.GetAdjective] agents who bribed him to betray us probably thought we would not notice their hand in the matter, but they were wrong. This intentional sabotage of our influence in the Curia is unacceptable and will not stand unchallenged."
 aow_events.44.a: "It is an affront to both us and our Church."
 aow_events.45.t: "Thoughts of Heresy"
 aow_events.45.d: "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has lived close to the heretics in our nation and rather than condemn them, he has tried to understand them. While a sympathetic course of action, he has recently approached one of our ministers confessing that he has himself started to doubt Church doctrine. If this came to the Pope's knowledge, he would no longer be allowed to serve in the Curia, but perhaps we could convince him to keep this to himself for a few ducats."
 aow_events.45.a: "Faith cannot be bought, but silence can."
 aow_events.45.a.tt: "the Pope discovering our actions."
 aow_events.45.b: "It's unfortunate, but he is ill suited for his position if he has doubts."
 aow_events.46.t: "Pope Discovers Duplicity"
 aow_events.46.d: "The cardinal we bribed to keep silent about his doubts of Church doctrine unfortunately still believed in confessing his sins. Even more unfortunately, the manner in which he did this to the Pope has not granted him forgiveness, perhaps because he does not truly regret his doubts. While he does regret taking our bribe, this too has come to the knowledge of the Holy Father, who is displeased with us as much as the now former cardinal."
 aow_events.46.a: "Is it too late for us to ask forgiveness, too?"
 aow_events.47.t: "Cardinal Distrusts Heathens"
 aow_events.47.d: "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has been loyal to [Root.Owner.GetName] so far, but is starting to have doubts about his continued stay here after seeing heathens living so close to his home city of [Root.GetCapitalName]. In a letter to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], he has claimed that these people cannot be trusted and requested that they be subject to much more stringent regulations than our other citizens."
 aow_events.47.a: "If we cannot judge someone's character by faith, what else?"
 aow_events.47.b: "We have no intentions of limiting their rights because of one man."
 aow_events.48.t: "Contacts in the Holy See"
 aow_events.48.d: "$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$, being a wise and respected Catholic, has maintained good relations with cardinals and other people in the Church even outside the borders of [Root.GetName]. They recently discovered that a man who has just been promoted to cardinal, who is also a good friend of theirs, is considering moving to our country to facilitate their mutual work on a theological text. If we aided this process, we would have a cardinal in the Curia who is not only loyal to $THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$, but also to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 aow_events.48.a: "Whatever we can do to help, we will."
 aow_events.48.b: "Our administration has other priorities than nepotism."
 aow_events.49.t: "Cardinal Minister"
 aow_events.49.d: "One of the cardinals in [Root.GetName] has proven to be a skilled administrator and already provides useful advice to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. At this point, making him a minister in our government would almost be only a formality, but an important formality nonetheless, since he may grow more powerful yet. Having a cardinal in our service would certainly lend us credibility with the Pope and strengthen the sentiment that [Root.GetName] is a Catholic nation first and foremost."
 aow_events.49.a: "He has aided us well so far, so let us get the formality over with."
 aow_events.49.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] does not need his advice to rule [Root.GetName]."
 aow_events.50.t: "Cardinal's Policies Upset Nobles"
 aow_events.50.d: "Since we made one of our cardinals a minister in our government, he has gone far beyond providing theological insights and innovated significantly in the administration of [Root.GetName]. Unfortunately, his suggestions of centralizing power are not possible without removing some authority from the nobles, who have begun to see him as an opportunist. At this point, trying to remove him from office over this dispute would probably mean we lost his loyalty altogether, but the nobles who stand to lose from his plans consider this a sacrifice easily worth making."
 aow_events.50.a: "The minister is showing us the path to the future."
 aow_events.50.b: "He has overstepped his authority and should be dismissed."
 aow_events.51.t: "Cardinal Sins"
 aow_events.51.d: "While conducting espionage in one of our neighboring countries, our operatives shadowed a powerful man, a cardinal, and discovered that although his loyalty appears incorruptible, his morals are already corrupt beyond what the Church can possibly imagine. Although the details of his transgressions are not of interest to us, they may be of interest to the Pope and give us a chance to weaken our neighbor's influence in the Curia. On the other hand, having a hold on a man of his rank could be useful in many situations."
 aow_events.51.a: "The Holy See must be informed of his actions."
 aow_events.51.b: "We can use this as blackmail to improve our spy network."
 aow_events.52.t: "Cardinal Exposed"
 aow_events.52.d: "The cardinal in [Root.GetName] has been rumored to be of weak character, but has always been discrete enough not to warrant further investigation. Now it appears that foreign spies from [From.GetName] who have had their eye on him put an end to this and exposed his sins to the Pope. His days as a cardinal are numbered, and our power in the Curia will be weakened due to this untimely [From.GetAdjective] intervention."
 aow_events.52.a: "What an underhanded way of getting at our influence."
 west_african.1.t: "The Sultanate of [Root.GetName]"
 west_african.1.d: "Our people have come a long way from their origins. Where there were once many tribes with their own customs and leaders, people throughout [Root.GetName] now recognize [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their ruler. Many have speculated that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may soon declare [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Sultan, but this may not go without contention unless the title is given to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by the Caliph.\n\nWord has reached us that the Ottoman Caliphate has its seat in the distant city of Istanbul and they may just be willing to grant us an audience. Perhaps with the Caliph's blessing, the Sultanate of [Root.GetName] will find support among the faithful of its citizens."
 west_african.1.a: "Let us travel to this faraway land and seek their support!"
 west_african.1.b: "We do not need their approval to reign!"
 west_african.2.t: "A Sultan in [From.GetName]"
 west_african.2.d: "An emissary has arrived from the lands of [From.GetName], seeking support from [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] capacity as Caliph for the creation of a new sultanate. Once a collection of disparate tribes, we are informed that the [From.GetAdjective] people are now pious Muslims and devoted to their ruler, [From.Monarch.GetName], who wishes to seize the title of Sultan with our support."
 west_african.2.a: "A noble goal. The foundation of a new sultanate is a blessing to us as well."
 west_african.2.b: "If you wish to be Sultan, you must convince the people yourself."
 west_african.3.t: "Caliph Approves of Sultanate"
 west_african.3.d: "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, bringing news of how the leader of the Muslim world has decreed that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now the Sultan of [Root.GetName]. What may have otherwise turned into a violent struggle for power and political upheaval will now see the support of most, maybe all, of the wise and faithful among the [Root.GetAdjective] people."
 west_african.3.a: "Only the unbelievers will oppose us now."
 west_african.4.t: "Caliph Disapproves of Sultanate"
 west_african.4.d: "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, but despite our best efforts, the Caliph would not grant us the title. According to [From.Monarch.GetHerHim], it is up to us to convince the people of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s capacity to rule as Sultan."
 west_african.4.a: "A Caliph displaying such poor judgment is hardly fit for the title."
 west_african.5.t: "People of the Desert"
 west_african.5.d: "The [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people have lived in this arid climate for a long time. Although this causes some foolish nations to dismiss us as inhabiting the land unwanted by others, we have mastered skills of survival and combat that they would be wise to fear.\n\nJust across the border at [Root.GetName], our brethren are suffering the oppression of other people, people who may not be prepared for what the [Root.Culture.GetName] are capable of when you underestimate them. With the help of these locals, we could organize a raid into the lands of their oppressors, striking quickly and taking advantage of the fact that we know the desert there better than anyone else."
 west_african.5.a: "We will arrive and withdraw like a sandstorm."
 west_african.5.b: "We will not assault our neighbors like this, regardless of who their subjects are."
 west_african.6.t: "Desert Raiders"
 west_african.6.d: "Some people from the [Root.Culture.GetName] elite have recently been attacked by what they believe to be a raid organized by foreign military. Initially, the attack seemed to have occurred too deep into our borders for this to be possible, but an explanation for how this could have happened has begun to take shape. The [From.Culture.GetName] in one of our border provinces, who we thought to be our loyal subjects, appear to have conspired with our neighbors to organize the attack.\n\nWhile it may not be possible to retaliate in kind, there are other ways we can show what we think of such cowardly tactics."
 west_african.6.a: "Sooner or later, they will pay."
 west_african.7.t: "A Safer Border"
 west_african.7.d: "A long time has passed, but we have not forgotten how [Root.GetName] once served as an entry point for an audacious attack to plunder our country. Many people believe that this threat remains real, and demands that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] act upon it, strengthening our control of the border and ensuring that desert raiders are not allowed to cross it ever again."
 west_african.7.a: "We will dispatch the necessary troops immediately."
 west_african.7.b: "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will travel to patrol the border [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]!"
 west_african.7.c: "Surely some local initiative can be arranged."
 west_african.8.t: "Wasteland to Some"
 west_african.8.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have always been resourceful and adaptive beyond what others would consider possible, and lands others may find impossible to inhabit or even traverse are our homes, our roads and our domain. We could made good use of this, including in our country's trade efforts. One of our main trade routes is in fact right next to such an area, and there have been discussions about how to best take advantage of this."
 west_african.8.a: "We can send our caravans on routes that we alone know."
 west_african.8.b: "It can be used as a base to stage an attack on the trade route."
 west_african.9.t: "Idolatry or Reverence?"
 west_african.9.d: "Our efforts to bring salvation to the heathens in [Root.GetName] have borne fruit, but it is a strange and unfamiliar fruit. The local population has started to accept Christ, but the faith has been intertwined with their old ways. Angels and spirits, the true Lord and the old Lord of the Sky, the Blessed Virgin and the Earth Goddess... do these people really believe in what they hear, or do they simply call their old idols by different names? The local missionary has come to us for advice, concerned about the souls of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people, and his own."
 west_african.9.a: "Their faith is pure, and we would be fools to reject it."
 west_african.9.b: "This is worse than heresy. It must be rooted out."
 west_african.10.t: "God of the Sky"
 west_african.10.d: "We trust in the spirits, in the gods that have always been with us, and our people are rarely impressed by the lies of those who would lead us from them. However, some people on our border who have come into contact with those who worship one they claim returned from the dead seem to have seen similarities between their faith and ours. Just as many here choose to worship the Sky Father, our neighbors speak of the one the call Christ as having a Heavenly Father himself. Many have begun to suggest that these two may be one and the same, and that the animosity between our faiths is nothing but a misunderstanding."
 west_african.10.a: "This is simply another lie they spread to force their faith upon us."
 west_african.10.b: "We have different names for many other things, so why not gods?"
 west_african.11.t: "Tradition or Haram?"
 west_african.11.d: "Bringing the word of the Prophet to the people of [Root.GetName] has not been impossible, but the outcome so far has troubled some of our religious scholars. Although they have abandoned many pagan traditions, a reverence for ancestors remains with troubling undertones of worship. We see no fault in honoring one's family, but when prayers are directed to the dead and not to God, can anything good really come of it? Nevertheless, these are ancient practices. Rejecting them may alienate many of those who would otherwise listen."
 west_african.11.a: "We will respect their practices as equal to our own."
 west_african.11.b: "There is no God but God. If they will not learn this, we have achieved nothing."
 west_african.12.t: "Many Spirits, One God"
 west_african.12.d: "We have known of the Muslim faith for a long time, but chosen to remain true to our traditions. Those who devote themselves only to the distant creator, forsaking the gods and spirits that dwell among us, are certainly on the path to misfortune.\n\nPeople at the border, who live next to Muslims every day, have started to see things differently. They find that the words of Muhammad speak to them as well as their neighbors and rather than seeing this as a betrayal of the old ways, they identify the prophet's God with our most revered sky deity."
 west_african.12.a: "Your ancestors go forgotten while you pray to the sky. This is unacceptable."
 west_african.12.b: "Perhaps if we accept their one God, they will consider our many."
 west_african.13.t: "No Compromises in Faith"
 west_african.13.d: "Although many of our citizens are not yet followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have remained hopeful and patient. Others are not so patient. Many of our citizens consider it absurd that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], ruling by the grace of God, accepts the widespread paganism in our country. This, in turn, has sparked concern among the very same pagans that they are subjects of an externally imposed belief system, with some of them calling for the overthrow of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does not show reverence for the spiritual practices that have lived with the people here for millennia."
 west_african.13.a: "The believers are right. We will not tolerate this godlessness."
 west_african.13.b: "The animists, although misguided, must be respected as citizens."
 west_african.13.c: "Let them resolve the matter amongst themselves."
 west_african.13.e: "There is time yet for reconciliation."
 west_african.14.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Scholars"
 west_african.14.d: "Although cut off from many of our faith, we have not forsaken Islamic scholarship. $THEOLOGIAN$ is just one of many who have written great works on the subject, their work inspiring countless others. Through our dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the theological works of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made it a famous city."
 west_african.14.a: "It shall remain a beacon of wisdom throughout the ages."
 west_african.15.t: "The Flora of [Root.GetName]"
 west_african.15.d: "The scholars and scientists among the [Root.GetAdjective] have been distinguished by extraordinary innovation and curiosity. Their latest efforts have focused on gathering information about the plant life of the large jungle areas of our land, hoping to gain useful information to aid in researching medicine and dyeing techniques. This has been successful so far, with the botany project rippling developments into other areas of research."
 west_african.15.a: "And much is yet to be discovered."
 west_african.16.t: "The Weapons of our Neighbors"
 west_african.16.d: "Although we do not doubt the strength and tenacity of our [Root.GetAdjective] warriors, the technological advances of the neighboring armies have not passed by without our notice. The adoption of firearms greatly changes warfare, and we can see clear advantages in this.\n\nOur neighbors are unlikely to provide us with all the technical details to fully equip our army, but they do seem willing to sell us some of their weapons. While this would probably give them an advantage in terms of our trade exchanges, it would doubtlessly be of use to our military efforts."
 west_african.16.a: "We must acquire this equipment at any cost."
 west_african.16.b: "Our army serves its purpose, with or without these weapons."
 west_african.17.t: "Transatlantic Slave Trade"
 west_african.17.d: "[Root.GetName] is far from the only country keeping slaves, with this being a common fate for war captives in the area. Our European neighbors seem to have especially interested in this lately, seemingly being in desperate need for servants to work the new land they have seized across the ocean. To this end, they are now attempting to arrange a long-term trade agreement with us that will facilitate this purchase of slaves.\n\nWhile we stand to earn money from this, the implications have been the cause of some concern. They apparently consider our people, or at least our captives, to be suitable as their slaves and treat them with unbounded brutality. We don't wish to humor this notion, but there is no telling what they might end up doing if we refuse."
 west_african.17.a: "None will be sold to these people if we can help it."
 west_african.17.b: "If they can pay, we can provide."
 west_african.17.c: "It's time to put an end to the practice of slavery, for us as well as for them."
 west_african.18.t: "Once Nomads"
 west_african.18.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people of [Root.GetName] have traditionally lived, at least in part, a nomadic life. Although our efforts to centralize have made this less feasible, people are used to it and expect us not to intervene. It does make [Root.Owner.GetName] more difficult to manage, however. Some of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors have suggested that we try to take control and restrict their movements, but this could be seen as trampling the way of life that made them successful in the first place."
 west_african.18.a: "Let them live as they always did."
 west_african.18.b: "[Root.GetName] is unruly enough as it is."
 west_african.19.t: "The Ashanti"
 west_african.19.d: "The Akan people of Kumasi and the surrounding region have lived there for a long time now, although we have not considered them a nation in their own right. However, their tribe is of such importance to our present affairs that we need to conduct trade and diplomacy with them. Although the nature of the Akan state may yet change, we cannot question its existence."
 west_african.19.a: "Who knows, one day they may become grow to the strength of an empire."
 west_african.20.t: "Sika 'dwa"
 west_african.20.d: "The Ashanti have neighbored one of colonies for some time, so far without any major diplomatic incidents. This all changed recently, when our governor $COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, our representative at the Gold Coast, heard of the Golden Stool. This mysterious old artifact apparently holds great significance to the Ashanti, to whom it is the seat of the king. Although we have been vaguely aware of its existence before, it recently came to the knowledge of $COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, who demands to sit on it as a demonstration of his, and by extension our, paramount power in the area. \n\n'Why am I not sitting on the Golden Stool at this moment?' he has asked the Ashanti, who have so far shown no sign of complying. Indeed, they seem highly insulted by the suggestion alone. How far should we be willing to pursue this?"
 west_african.20.a: "As far as it takes!"
 west_african.20.a.tt: "The Ashanti may not take kindly to this."
 west_african.20.b: "We have no use for a man who demands such means to assert his dominance."
 west_african.21.t: "War of the Golden Stool"
 west_african.21.d: "The Golden Stool is the symbol of the Ashanti king, which no one is allowed to violate. Now, the [From.GetAdjective], who we trusted had some respect for our traditions despite their disinterest in them, have sent a governor here who demands to sit upon the Stool as if he was king himself. This has outraged the Queen Mother and many others, who are arguing that this man must be stopped and the sanctity of the Golden Stool preserved, at the cost of war if necessary."
 west_african.21.a: "If [From.GetName] trusts such a fool to represent them, there can only be war."
 west_african.21.b: "Traditions are not worth starting a war over."
 west_african.22.t: "Self-rule for the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 west_african.22.d: "The [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] rule [Root.Owner.GetName] justly, we believe. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has been fair to the different tribes under our rule, but to some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects, this is not enough. The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have sent a representative from [Root.GetName], requesting greater rights to make decisions about their own tribes if they are to remain under the reign of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. Although seemingly a humble request, the news of discontent in their home provinces makes it sound more like a demand."
 west_african.22.a: "The tribes are best ruled that rule themselves."
 west_african.22.b: "We don't give into demands, even if veiled."
 west_african.23.t: "Raids Through the Jungle"
 west_african.23.d: "Ever since our adoption of cavalry, the mounted warriors of [Root.GetName] have been feared by all for their uncanny ability to rapidly attack deep inside enemy territory, raiding and weakening the defenses. A group of soldiers have prepared a plan to aid the ongoing war based on this tactic, preparing to break off from the main army and perform the attack in secret, before the enemy can react. Although a risky plan, it could yield much-needed funds for the war."
 west_african.23.a: "We need more plans like these!"
 west_african.23.b: "Bring me those who planned this and let them aid our greater schemes instead."
 west_african.24.t: "Into the Unknown"
 west_african.24.d: "The uncharted territory within and beyond the jungles at our border may seem threatening to many other people. But our tribe has lived in lands like these for a long time, and would never have thrived if we feared exploring the unknown. Now, a large group of young hunters are asking for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s permission to explore and settle in whatever place they may discover. Certainly, these are capable people who could get a lot done if they didn't waste time on dreams of places not yet known, but who are we to put a stop to youthful curiosity?"
 west_african.24.a: "Go and claim what you find for [Root.GetName]!"
 west_african.24.b: "We are the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they are needed here."
 west_african.25.t: "New Dyes"
 west_african.25.d: "Our research into the plant life of [Root.GetName] continues to lead to new discoveries. We have recently uncovered a new way to create dyes, which is both efficient and results in impressive colors not found anywhere else that we know of. Since dyes is one of the important [Root.GetAdjective] exports, we will see that these valuable techniques are spread quickly throughout our land."
 west_african.25.a: "We are dyeing to try them out!"
 west_african.26.t: "The Spirits Remain"
 west_african.26.d: "Many foreign religions have attempted to set their roots among us and many missionaries have tried to turn us towards a God, always the one God, always the same, always different, always theirs. But despite the trying times we have gone through, we keep honoring the spirits and our ancestors. Now the elders have told us that the time is right for a larger celebration of these ancient rites and that people throughout [Root.GetName] should be encouraged to participate.\n\nWith the very people who would see us converted right across the border, this sort of nationwide event would probably attract some irritation from those who consider themselves above it. Our diplomats are suggesting we keep it at a smaller scale, so as to not offend our neighbors."
 west_african.26.a: "Our ancestors did not cower in shame, and neither do we!"
 west_african.26.b: "We can't afford to anger those who have forgotten the truth."
 west_african.27.t: "Immortal [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 west_african.27.d: "[Root.GetName] is a country with many skilled artisans and craftsmen. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is often expected to commission a work of art to commemorate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessor, a tradition which aids both remembering our ancestors and demonstrating the wealth and influence of the current ruler.\n\nMany materials are available, with bronze being the traditional choice. We should pick something suitable for both the grandeur of the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and affordable for [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 west_african.27.a: "Our sculptors can do miracles with terracotta."
 west_african.27.b: "Bronzework is suitable for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 west_african.27.c: "If we can get the ivory needed, it could be a work for the ages."
 west_african.27.e: "Nothing less than gold will do."
 west_african.27.f: "We cannot afford such frivolities."
 west_african.28.t: "Guns of the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 west_african.28.d: "While our efforts to adopt certain technologies from Europe have been somewhat impeded by the ongoing war, applying our new weapons in the field has had a positive impact. Our soldiers have turned out to be very capable with firearms, and people in the army who have been skeptical to our efforts are now much more positive. Although we are a long way from fully equipping our soldiers with guns, we have taken significant steps along the way."
 west_african.28.a: "[Root.GetAdjective] warriors are already feared today. They will be unstoppable tomorrow."

 flavor_vij.16.a: "Ok."
 flavor_vij.17.t: "Pulicat"
 flavor_vij.17.d: "The Northern Coromandel coast and the city of Pulicat in particular is vital to our empire. It is through this coastal strip that all of the goods of the east reaches the demanding 500 000 souls in our imperial capital.\nAs the area recovers from the Orissan occupation, and as the capital of Vijayanagar itself keeps growing, the port now seems to have entered a golden age of economic growth and prosperity."
 flavor_vij.17.a: "Ok."
 flavor_vij.18.t: "Tirupati-Tirumala Temple Complex"
 flavor_vij.18.d: "Perhaps the greatest temple of all in our lands, the great temple of Venkateshwara and the connected temple city of Tirupati has increasingly come to be connected with the rulers of our state. Over the years it has grown from a major pilgrimage to one of the great temple cities in India. The city is supported by the donations of countless treasures as well as over 40 villages providing it with food and income.\nWe should, however, not be content with this. By increasing our support, providing it with even more villages and donations, we could ensure that it becomes the greatest temple city in all of Southern India. May Tirupati prosper for as long as our empire grows!"
 flavor_vij.18.a: "Donate lavishly."

 flavor_vij.19.d: "An ambassador of Shah Rukh in faraway Samarkand arrived today in our capital. While the Timurid had traveled far and seen many great things on his way to our great city he appeared very impressed by what he found here. His knowledge of the world outside of India as well as the observations he could share regarding the lands of our direct neighbors will be very useful to us."
 flavor_vij.19.a: "Ok."
 flavor_vij.20.t: "The Chalukya Imperial Capital"
 flavor_vij.20.d: "Though they are long gone, the Chalukya Empire which stretched from the Deccan to the Tamil kingdoms remains a powerful memory. As our own empire has expanded and advanced, the poets and chroniclers write as though Vijayanagar were the Chalukya Empire reborn. Now that we have seized the ancient Chalukya capital of Kalyana, located not far from the former Bahmani capital of Bidar, we have an opportunity to relocate the court to the northern city so that we can fully claim the Chalukya legacy as our own.\n\nThe traditional capital at Vijayangar, The City of Victory, yet remains a great and prestigious city however, and allows us to forge an imperial legacy of our own."
 flavor_vij.20.a: "The City of Victory will remain our capital."
 flavor_vij.20.b: "We will claim the Chalukya legacy, move the capital to Kalyana!"
 flavor_vij.20.c: "Leave the capital in its present location."
 flavor_vij.21.t: "The City of Victory"
 flavor_vij.21.d: "The Vijayangar Empire stands victorious over all of its enemies; the upstart Bahmani Sultanate is utterly defeated, the Tamil kings dutifully accept our rule, and we have even added Andhra and Lanka to our domain. Feasts and festivals in the capital celebrate the moment of our victory in south India as the Maharaja confers upon [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] the title of Chhatrapati in a clear message to the world that Vijayanagar will submit to no foreign power."

 flavor_mor.1.t: "Crisis of the Maghreb"
 flavor_mor.1.d: "The last century has been a harsh and unforgiving one for the countries of the Maghreb. Due to increasing desertification, shrinking urban population, general famine and increasingly strong groups disloyal of nomads roaming the countryside most of the states in North Africa have seen better days.\nWhile things are looking up a bit lately, internal trade is on the rise and there are signs of increasing urbanization again, our states are still shadows of their former selves. Many fear that once the Iberians have finished off the Kingdom of Granada they will be coming for us."

 flavor_mor.2.t: "Moorish Refugees"
 flavor_mor.2.d: "Spain has chosen to expel the Moors that still resided within her borders. Large numbers of Andalusian Moorish refugees have therefore been arriving in our ports, asking to be let into our country. While it pains us that these of people had to leave their homes this may well be a blessing for our kingdom. Most of the refugees are city dwellers, craftsmen, scholars, artists and administrators. Precisely the kind of people our own cities have a great shortage of after the great crisis of the Maghreb."

With him from the holy land al-Jazuli brings the Dala'il al-Khayrat, a prayer book in which he has collected litanies asking God to bless, show mercy and kindness to Muhammed.\nUnlike al-Jazuli himself the book can be in many places and given its fantastic popularity it seems destined to survive both him and our dynasty."

Ever since this event the Idrisid sharifs have been the center of a growing a cult in Fez and in our kingdom in general.\nThis devout cult seems destined to lift the hearts our population after the harsh period we have left behind us. There is, however, always a risk with passionate popular movements like this one, it wouldn't do for them to forget who wields the temporal power."

 flavor_mor.5.t: "Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi"
 flavor_mor.5.d: "In all but name Morocco has not one but two royal dynasties. Since twenty years past almost all power formally held by the Marinid dynasty has in fact been wielded by their formidable Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya.\nInsanely popular after his victory over the Portuguese in 1437 and his patronization of the Idrisid cult in Fez, Abu Zakariya Yahya has ensured that the royal bureaucracy is both well functioning and imbued with Wattasid family members. As the Wattasids are related to the Marinid rulers this is in itself perhaps not a worrying development. Now that Abu Zakariya Yahya lies on his deathbed, however, we cannot but wonder what the future will bring. The great man has seemingly left nothing to chance and has already arranged for his cousin to succeed him as Vizier but what remains unclear is what the Wattasid family will do in the future with the network Yahya has built them."
 flavor_mor.5.a: "We have lost a great man."
 flavor_mor.6.t: "A Wattasid Conspiracy?"
 flavor_mor.6.d: "It is clear to us now that the Wattasid family has been allowed to grow too strong and influential in our kingdom. Unless we move to curb their power now we might not be able to further down the line. Sultan $MONARCH$ is convinced there is a conspiracy against the throne afoot."
 flavor_mor.6.a: "Kill them all!"

 flavor_mor.7.t: "Wattasid Revolt."
 flavor_mor.7.d: "In what was seen as a sudden betrayal of our Wattasid viziers our Sultan has had all the Wattasids he could find rounded up and executed. The popularity of the Wattasid family, however, means that this has been a very unpopular move.\nAs $MONARCH$ appointed a new, non Wattasid, vizier to serve him yesterday riots broke out and it is rumored that somewhere two Wattasid brothers remain hidden to take control over this revolt, determined to avenge their family."
 flavor_mor.7.a: "Ok."
 flavor_mor.8.t: "Wattasid Ultimatum"

 flavor_mor.12.desc: "Throughout its history, several great cities have had the honor of being the political center of the Moroccan sultanate. Under the Idrisids and Marinids, the northern city of Fez has been the favored seat of government, allowing its rulers to lead the charge against their enemies in Iberia and the eastern Maghreb. The Almavorids and Almohads favored the southern city of Marrakech, while Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur attempted to establish the capital at Rabat. Some in the court argue that Meknes could also serve as a political center. Any of these cities would make a fine capital for our nation."

Sensing weakness, the Sufis, tribes, and Emirs have begun to form alliances and make marriage pacts among one another. Though many in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s court are content to leave them to their own devices and cloister themselves in [Root.Capital.GetName], the threat from the south will only continue to grow if they are not dealt with."

 flavor_mal.2.t: "Emergence of the Fulani"
 flavor_mal.2.d: "A group of wandering nomads known as the Fulani have united under the leadership of Tengella and his son Koly. Migrating south the Fulani have now formed an expansionist state around Futa Tooro with its eyes set on the entire Senegambian region. These Fulani seem to have no respect for our borders and there have been numerous incidents already of these tribesmen penetrating deep into our lands, levying taxes on our people and undermining our authority."
 flavor_mal.2.a: "Ok."
 flavor_mal.4.t: "The Wangara and the Portuguese"
 flavor_mal.4.d: "Having adopted a less violent approach, Portuguese traders have become an increasingly common sight along our western coasts. In many ways this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by Portuguese merchants. For gold or slaves there is not much the Portuguese wouldn't sell us and our merchant caste, the Wangara, is thriving due to this new partnership.\nThere is, however, a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seem to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures haven't gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely can't have our best interests at heart."
 flavor_mal.4.a: "Ok."
 flavor_mal.5.t: "Portuguese Meddling"
 flavor_mal.5.d: "The Portuguese traders on our western coast have become quite a nuisance lately. While the horses they bring for our armies and the exotic goods they bring from far away countries are of great use to us it seems they cannot help but meddle in the local politics. It is clear that several chiefs that are in contact with the Portuguese have been encouraged to extend their personal authority and to slowly attempt to cut the ties with our central administration.\nIn order to deal with this we could either strike at the chiefs themselves or attempt to limit the influence of the Portuguese."
 flavor_mal.5.a: "Act decisively to limit Portuguese influence."

 flavor_mal.6.t: "Islamization of the Aristocracy"

Islam has, however, been gaining more ground lately among the aristocracy and wandering marabouts have also become an increasingly common sight even in the farthest corners of our lands.\nIn the past our predecessors have all avoided trying to be too forceful about converting their subjects but if we wish we could probably make use of these recent developments to encourage the spread of the true faith."
 flavor_mal.6.a: "Let us convert our people!"
 flavor_mal.6.b: "Let us not rock the boat."
 flavor_mal.7.t: "Unsafe Roads"
 flavor_mal.7.d: "The time needed to complete a journey from our capital to the coast has risen alarmingly due to the direct route being plagued by bandits, Fulani raiders and local chiefs hoping to enrich themselves by waylaying the rich Wangara traders.\nUnless we attempt to address this issue soon we may find ourselves losing contact with the outlying parts of our empire."

He has now threatened to sever the ties with us completely and has started to deal with the European trading nations directly rather than as our representative. Never very committed to the Malian state religion Kaabu has grown to be a stronghold of the local traditional religion and its new rulers have been quick to use this against us.\nWith a strong religious identity and its Atlantic trade ties Kaabu has every chance of becoming a durable state. If we are to stop this we should probably act as soon as possible."

It seems very unlikely that an Ethiopian monarch would risk the safety of his patriarch over a matter such as this."
 flavor_eth.12.a: "Send a sarcastic reply."
 flavor_eth.12.b: "Attempt to apologize and repair relations."
 flavor_eth.13.t: "A letter has arrived from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.13.d: "We have received word that the Emperor of Ethiopia feels we are mistreating the Coptic population in our lands. He clearly sees this as a cause for war and there is much speculation that an Ethiopian attack might be imminent."
 flavor_eth.13.a: "They wouldn't dare."
 flavor_eth.14.t: "An ambassador from the Mameluks"
 flavor_eth.14.d: "Today a Mameluk messenger arrived at our court bearing the reply of the Sultan to our concerns about the Copts in his lands.\nThe reply is far from the apology we had expected however. The Sultan has chosen to show his contempt for the Ethiopian court and he ridicules any form of retribution that we might attempt."
 flavor_eth.14.a: "Imprison the Ambassador."
 flavor_eth.14.b: "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.14.c: "Let's just drop it."
 flavor_eth.15.t: "Mameluks Apologize"
 flavor_eth.15.d: "The Mameluk Sultan has sent word that he is looking into the situation of Copts in his lands. He assures us that he has nothing but feelings of friendship towards the Ethiopian people and the Coptic church."
 flavor_eth.15.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.16.t: "Ambassador Detained"
 flavor_eth.16.d: "The Ethiopian emperor was so displeased by our reply to his letter that he had our messenger detained."
 flavor_eth.16.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.17.t: "Death of a Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.d: "The Bishop of Ethiopia has died and the Ethiopian church has requested a successor from the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria.\nWhile a successor has been chosen by the Patriarch this would be a good opportunity to show the Ethiopians who is in charge. The Emperor of Ethiopia has actively pursued a policy of conversion against his Muslim subjects and he still detains the ambassador we sent to chastise him last time."
 flavor_eth.17.a: "Prevent the appointment of a new Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.b: "We must not interfere in these matters"
 flavor_eth.18.t: "Bishop missing"
 flavor_eth.18.d: "It has been a long while now since the last bishop of Ethiopia died and we requested a successor from Alexandria. Could the Mamluks be interfering?"
 flavor_eth.18.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.19.t: "The Monastic Orders"
 flavor_eth.19.d: "One of the greatest strengths of the Ethiopian church is the great number of successful monasteries that dot the landscape of our state. The Monastic orders have contributed to the success of our state by founding new monasteries in newly conquered areas and by spreading the word of the true faith there. The monasteries of Ethiopia are also the source of the education of the Ethiopian clergy, its nobility and its administrators and as such have contributed greatly to the revitalization of the Ethiopian church in the years past.\nThe other side of this coin, however, is that the monasteries and the orders that run them have grown both rich and autonomous."
 flavor_eth.19.a: "Attempt to rein them in."
 flavor_eth.19.b: "Safeguard the privileges of the orders"
 flavor_eth.20.t: "Independence from the Patriarchate"
 flavor_eth.20.d: "The dependency of the Ethiopian church on the Patriarchate of Alexandria has always been a liability for our country. Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian church over the last two centuries, however, means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Muslim conquerors we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our own clergy."
 flavor_eth.20.a: "We cannot dishonor our Patriarch."
 flavor_eth.20.b: "Our Church should be free of foreign influence."
 flavor_eth.21.t: "The Oromo"
 flavor_eth.21.d: "A strange nomadic people have crossed our border from the African interior into our borderlands. Migrating in large numbers protected by very able warriors, their alien customs threaten to rip apart and reshape the very fabric of society here.\nThese disciples of Waaq are quickly displacing and converting the followers of the all faiths in the area, replacing old social structures with new ones of their own."
 flavor_eth.21.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.23.t: "Oromo Settlers"
 flavor_eth.23.d: "Groups of nomadic settlers have entered the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The province population is being either displaced or assimilated by the Oromo."
 flavor_eth.23.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.24.t: "Integration of the Oromo"
 flavor_eth.24.d: "It seems the waves of Oromo settlers moving into our lands have finally faltered. The immigrants themselves have also begun to settle down and while our society is changed in many ways the violent initial phase of integration of this new people seem to be over."
 flavor_eth.24.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.26.t: "Amba Geshen - The Mountain of Kings"
 flavor_eth.26.d: "Once, our great kingdom was plagued by crisis and civil strife upon every succession. In order to deal with this problem one of the first of the Solomonic kings therefore set up the institution of Mount Geshen. Ever since that day all royal princes except the direct heir of the king are kept isolated from the outside world on the slopes of Mount Geshen. The state ensures that these potential kings lack for nothing and this time of isolation may be used for study and contemplation by the princes. In order to protect the princes from the outside world, and in order to protect the kingdom from the claims of the princes, the mountain is kept under close guard.\nThis custom has served us well over the years and the kingdom has become much more stable than it once was. Still some feel that keeping all of our royal heirs in one place is quite risky.\nToday we find ourselves with an aging king and no heir to succeed, it is precisely in situations like these that the mountain might come in handy."
 flavor_eth.26.a: "We are fortunate that our ancestors had such foresight."
 flavor_eth.26.b: "We have no need for this gilded prison."
 flavor_eth.26.b.tt: "The mountain will be used for other purposes"
 flavor_eth.27.t: "Helen of Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.27.d: "Early on in his reign king $MONARCH$ married the daughter of one of the Muslim chiefs of the kingdom. As the young woman converted and said her vows to the Ethiopian emperor there was no way to know that this would turn out to be one of the most influential persons in Ethiopian politics for years to come. Eleni or Helen would in time serve not only her husband but several successive kings after him as an able advisor and as a power behind the throne."
 flavor_eth.27.a: "Ok."
 flavor_eth.28.t: "Disaster at the Mountain of Kings"
 flavor_eth.28.d: "Nobody knows exactly what happened but news reached us today that all of the princes on Mount Geshen are dead. It would appear that someone managed to surprise the guards to then proceed to slaughter the royal heirs. As the kingdom tries to recover from the shock it is clear that this particular tradition will no longer be part of our national heritage."

Less than a generation ago Nur Qutb-i ‘Alam, leader of the Chishti in Bengal ensured our return to power as the Sultanate was threatened by a Hindu usurper.\nAs the sad news of Nur Qutb-i ‘Alam's passing now reach us the time has come to reaffirm this alliance between worldly and spiritual power. On the other hand this might also be a good opportunity to distance the throne from the Chishti order, an organization which has grown a bit too powerful for comfort."

The clearing of land to allow our ever-growing population some room to spread is a process that has been going on slowly but steadily for longer than anyone can remember.\nRecently a number of holy men, many of them Sufis have begun to get involved in this process. These holy men have mobilized the hearts of our people and the process of land reclamation suddenly seems to be going a lot smoother than it ever has before. As if to confirm that things are now moving in the right direction the flow of the great river Ganges itself has shifted in a way that has further helped this process along."

According to the story the vast majority of the prisoners died due to the horrible conditions they had to endure there.

On the site of an old fort squarely in the middle of the Deccan plateau an entirely new capital has been built, a magnificent city comparable to the great cities of Persia and Transoxiana. With its 37 bastions and 7 gates Bidar is also an impressive fort and the foremost defense of our dynasty.\nBuilt to impress the royal court itself, it is no less awe-inspiring and the audience hall with the Turquoise throne of our dynasty is perhaps the most renowned symbol of our family.\nNone of this comes cheap of course.

The vast majority of our subjects are Hindu Marathas, Kannadigas and Telugus.\nWith northern India closed to us by the Delhi Sultans for so long we have had to rely on oversea immigration directly from Persia and the Arab world to fill the needs of our state.\nOur dynasty has therefore always spent much energy trying to attract able and learned men to what has become a rather cosmopolitan kingdom. Since we lost control of the western coast, however, it seems this stream of able people has been transformed into a trickle. If we want to avert a serious crisis we must double our efforts to lure all men of quality here despite the risks."

 flavor_guj.11.t: "Death of Ahmad Kattu"
 flavor_guj.11.d: "Ahmad Kattu, Sufi master and supporter of our family has passed away. This great man has acted as an advisor for more than one generation of Gujarati Sultans and once took part in the planning of the great city of Ahmadabad. This loss leaves a great spiritual void in our kingdom and our dynasty will be forever in his debt."
 flavor_guj.11.a: "We must construct a magnificent mausoleum to honor this great man."
 flavor_guj.11.b: "This is a great loss for the kingdom."
 flavor_guj.12.t: "Qissa-i Sanjan - The Parsee Community of Gujarat"
 flavor_guj.12.d: "Many hundred years ago a group of Zoroastrian refugees from Persia settled down in Gujarat, founding the Parsee community of Sanjan. Through the centuries this religious minority has proved resilient and has taken an active part in the development of this dynamic region.\nRecently a Parsee priest has recorded the oral historical tradition of the Parsees, from their exodus from Persia in the 10th century up to today. The resulting Qissa-i Sanjan is surely a classical example of high class Persian poetry but it is above all a story that will be treasured by the Parsees themselves for generations to come."
 flavor_guj.12.a: "Ok."
 flavor_guj.13.t: "Mirat-i-Sikandiri"
 flavor_guj.13.d: "The Gujarat Sultanate has a rich tradition of historical writing and over the year many court historians have received the patronage of our dynasty. The recently completed Mirat-i-Sikandiri by Shaikh Sikandar ibn Muhammad Manjhu is not only an excellent example of this but also tries to incorporate all previous writings on its subject. The resulting work is a detailed chronicle over the history of the Sultanate of Gujarat from its creation up until today."

 tyw_events.1.t: "Reservatum Ecclesiasticum"
 tyw_events.1.d: "As Emperor, we may have to accept that some of our subjects fall to heresy to avoid internal conflict. The ruler dictates the religion of the realm, after all. We may not afford to be so lenient with ecclesiastical principalities, however. One of the Prince-Bishops who rule in the Holy Roman Empire appears to have abandoned the Church and listened to the lies of the Protestants, risking not only his own soul, but those of all his subjects. Thanks to the ecclesiastical reservation, we reserve the right to force him to resign in the event of betrayal like this."
 tyw_events.1.a: "Enforce it! A good Catholic will take his place."
 tyw_events.1.a.tt: "Send word to the [This.Monarch.GetTitle] of [This.GetName]. We will know his response in two weeks' time."

 tyw_events.2.t: "Emperor Demands Resignation"
 tyw_events.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s conversion to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith appears to have angered Emperor [From.Monarch.GetName]. [From.GetName] is now claiming to enforce the Reservatum Ecclesiasticum, a measure that forces [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s within the Empire to give up their titles if they convert from Catholicism. The reservation is not supported among Protestants in the Empire, and perhaps it would lose some of its authority if genuinely contested."
 tyw_events.2.a: "It's in the Emperor's right."
 tyw_events.2.b: "Never! There is salvation outside the Church!"
 tyw_events.3.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] Refuses Resignation"
 tyw_events.3.d: "To our surprise and outrage, [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has refused to accept the validity of the ecclesiastical reservation as we interpret it, claiming that evoking it is proof of tyranny on our part. If we wish to save the souls of the [From.GetAdjective] people, it appears we have to enforce the true faith ourselves."
 tyw_events.3.a: "The heretics will burn."
 tyw_events.4.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] Resigns"
 tyw_events.4.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has wisely accepted our enforcement of the ecclesiastical reservation and resigned in favor of the Catholic [From.Monarch.GetName]. We have also demonstrated that the Holy Roman Empire stays true to its name and that we expect our religious leaders, if not all princes, remain on the true path or give their title to one who does."
 tyw_events.4.a: "The Emperor protects."
 tyw_events.5.t: "Blockade"
 tyw_events.5.d: "The people of [Root.GetCapitalName] rely heavily on their port to supply the city with what it needs, but the blockade against [Root.GetName] has cut off both many luxuries and some goods they claim are necessary to run the city. The people can hardly make do with [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] alone, and are turning to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to find a solution."

 tyw_events.6.d: "Mysterious phenomena on the night sky have often been interpreted as bad omens or signs of the end times. An exceptionally noticeable such phenomenon, a great comet, has been visible recently, causing more of a stir than usual.\n\n$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$, however, has taken the opportunity to closely observe the comet's movements. The result has been a scientific work that tells us much about the object's distance from us and dispels many old superstitions about comets. While it appears uncertain if commoners will remember this in the future, this comet has provided more insight than fear."
 tyw_events.6.a: "Keep looking at the sky!"
 tyw_events.7.t: "Education for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tyw_events.7.d: "The tragic passing of the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has left [Root.Heir.GetName] without a parent, but not without guardians or tutors. Advisors serving at our court are preoccupied with giving [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] the best education available in preparation of ruling [Root.GetName]. Hoping to gain favor and influence in the future, many people try to serve as a primary influence. Ultimately, one of them is likely to succeed, impacting what sort of ruler [Root.Heir.GetName] will turn out to be."
 tyw_events.7.a: "An advisor working in the administrative division will provide the best education."

 tyw_events.8.t: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 tyw_events.8.d: "Although Scotland has so far managed to stay out of the religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it is not for lack of interest. We are keenly aware that this war will impact all of Europe and are not without diplomatic stake in the outcome. Although Scotland may not be willing to go to war for a League, many Scots are. Serving as mercenaries in foreign armies on the continent, they may well change the course of the war without our direct involvement."
 tyw_events.8.a: "Send them to fight for the Evangelical League."
 tyw_events.8.b: "Send them to fight for the Catholic League."
 tyw_events.8.c: "We need all the troops we can muster right here."
 tyw_events.9.t: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 tyw_events.9.d: "Mercenaries from Scotland have begun to join our ranks in large numbers. Reports indicate that our allies are also seeing many of them arriving to join the righteous in our efforts to finish the religious struggles in the Holy Roman Empire once and for all. Although their nation is not joining us in the war, the Scots appear to be willing to fight for our League, for the right price."
 tyw_events.9.a: "Then we shall be willing to pay it."
 tyw_events.10.t: "Hungarians Revolt Against Habsburg Rule"
 tyw_events.10.d: "The Hungarian people of [Root.GetName] have begun to see the religious conflict in the Empire as one between them and the Habsburgs who rule [Root.Owner.GetName]. When war rages between Protestant and Catholic kings and emperors, they claim that the people must take up arms to protect their faith as well. As if the ongoing war was not enough, we must now grapple with these troublemakers in lands that should long since have accepted being ruled by the Habsburg dynasty."
 tyw_events.10.a: "Our enemies spread lies everywhere."
 tyw_events.11.t: "Huguenots Gather in La Rochelle"
 tyw_events.11.d: "The wars of religion may be over, but the religious conflicts in France are not. The Huguenot heretics, claiming to be concerned about their right to practice their faith under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName], have started to prepare for what might very well be open revolt. Although they have not gone that far yet, they have gathered in the city of La Rochelle and started to fortify its defensive structures. Their exact intentions are not clear, but the more rebellious among them claim that they will create an independent state, breaking free from French and Catholic rule."
 tyw_events.11.a: "If this continues, we may just turn out to be as ruthless as they claim us to be."
 tyw_events.12.t: "Huguenot Rebels Need Our Help"
 tyw_events.12.d: "Although [Root.GetName] is now free from the tyranny of the Catholic Church, many suffer the same oppression abroad. The Huguenots in France have found it necessary to build fortifications in preparation of the terrors the French regime no doubt are willing to visit upon them.\n\nAs true as the faith of these brave people might be, it is doubtful if they have the means to resist the power of the French army. However, with the backing of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], anything is possible."
 tyw_events.12.a: "Tell them to strike against the French, and we will follow!"
 tyw_events.12.b: "We would rather not draw the wrath of France."
 tyw_events.13.t: "British Support for Huguenots"
 tyw_events.13.d: "The Huguenot dissidents who gathered in La Rochelle, previously showing at least some caution, have been emboldened by the support of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle]. Apparently the treacherous heretics in [From.GetName] have seen it fit not only to spread their lies to France, but to spark fires here as well. Whether or not they will honor their promise, the Huguenots are now in open revolt."
 tyw_events.13.a: "Enemies of France will pay for this, in La Rochelle as well as in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tyw_events.14.t: "Fall of Prague"
 tyw_events.14.d: "Prague has been home to many kings and even emperors and is a city with many legacies within it. With today's capture by [Root.GetAdjective] troops, there is certainly a temptation to bring some of the city's treasures back to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and claim them for our own. With some rare artifacts being peerless in the known world, this may be our only chance to get our hands on them... but hardly without drawing the anger of Prague's citizens."
 tyw_events.14.a: "Bring these to our capital! That is how legacies are built."
 tyw_events.14.b: "These treasures belong here."
 tyw_events.15.t: "Albrecht von Wallenstein"
 tyw_events.15.d: "A noble of the House of Waldstein has emerged as a talented general amidst the religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire. Hailing from Bohemia, Wallenstein proved his loyalty to the emperor early in the war. He has already begun to provide insights and innovation both on the larger and smaller scale of warfare and will, we hope, continue to be a valuable asset in our efforts to restore faith and order to the Empire."
 tyw_events.15.a: "Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs loyalty now more than ever."
 tyw_events.16.t: "Wallenstein's Loyalties Doubted"
 tyw_events.16.d: "Since joining our forces early in the war, Wallenstein has shown himself to be very capable as a military commander. However, although he has made an effort to appear loyal and grateful, he is known to disagree with many of Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decisions. Reliable sources indicate that he has even been angered by some of our refusals to compromise in the conflict. Many now suspect him of considering defecting to the enemy. Fortunately, some of the officers in his forces are still loyal to us first. They could ensure he never fights for another League."
 tyw_events.16.a: "He needs to be captured, alive or dead."
 tyw_events.16.b: "We need him alive, leading out troops."
 tyw_events.17.t: "Wallenstein Betrays Us"
 tyw_events.17.d: "The worst fears of our advisors have proven true. Our dependence on Wallenstein's military leadership while the war put increased strain on our nation and Empire made him bold enough to desert us in the midst of the war, fleeing to join the enemy. Our troops have not seen the last of him on the battlefields, but he will now be leading the armies of the traitors against the Emperor."
 tyw_events.17.a: "We should have had him killed while we had the chance."
 tyw_events.17.a.tt: "Albrecht von Wallenstein will defect to [This.GetName]."
 tyw_events.18.t: "General Wallenstein Defects from [From.GetName]"
 tyw_events.18.d: "Our war to stop the [From.Religion.GetName] tyranny of the Holy Roman Emperor in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made even [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own generals doubt their cause. After seeing [From.GetName]'s refusal to compromise as the war drags on, Albrecht von Wallenstein has decided that he would be better off serving us. It appears they doubted his loyalties one time too many."
 tyw_events.18.a: "A self-fulfilling prophecy, but fortunate for us."
 tyw_events.19.t: "Winter Siege"
 tyw_events.19.d: "A siege dragging on over winter is always costly and best avoided completely. This winter has been particularly harsh and one of our sieges has seen both equipment and soldiers freezing. At this rate, we'll either have to recuperate and wait out the winter or send in more men, many of whom are likely to die from cold and starvation. How many are we willing to sacrifice to take this one city?"
 tyw_events.19.a: "As many as it takes."
 tyw_events.19.b: "Let us bide our time."
 tyw_events.20.t: "End of the House of Griffins"
 tyw_events.20.d: "The tumultuous state of the Holy Roman Empire has taken a toll on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s health. Our small nation lies in the midst of a brewing conflict, and at the worst possible time, our ruler is in poor health and lacks heirs. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] passing, Pomerania sees the end of the Griffins, who have ruled this nation for centuries, and risks partition by the powers who are opportunistically striking against the weakest parts of the Empire."
 tyw_events.20.a: "We will persist as sovereign through these hard times."
 tyw_events.20.a.tt: "[This.GetName] will gain claims on all Pomeranian provinces."
 tyw_events.21.t: "End of the House of Griffins"
 tyw_events.21.d: "After ruling Pomerania for centuries, the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the House of Griffins to reign in the country has passed away without an heir. With the ongoing religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it would not be impossible for someone with ambition to lay claim to the region. However, we are not the only ones who have noticed this, and many powers may soon prepare to get their share to Pomeranian lands."
 tyw_events.21.a: "We know an opportunity when we see one."
 tyw_events.22.t: "Battle of [Root.GetCapitalName]"
 tyw_events.22.d: "The League war has been brought to the heart of our nation, and yet we have suffered defeat. [From.GetAdjective] forces engaged ours near our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and won, which has caused both concern and shame in our military. The war may be won yet, but this battle may still be remembered, whether we like it or not."
 tyw_events.22.a: "We can only hope our future successes will overshadow it."
 tyw_events.23.t: "Enemies of the League"
 tyw_events.23.d: "Our decision to take a stance in the religious conflict in the Holy Roman Empire has caused even more heated discussions about where [Root.GetName] stands on the issue of the Reformation. We may not doubt the goals of the League, but there is no shortage of people in our country who do. What is obvious to us, that we have chosen the right side for the good of all [Root.GetAdjective] people regardless of faith, seems like the lies of heretics to some of our subjects. The most zealous objectors have taken up arms against their rulers and the League."
 tyw_events.23.a: "How little these people know of international affairs."
 tyw_events.24.t: "$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ Questions Our Faith"
 tyw_events.24.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is a practically minded ruler. Although as pious as any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], politically expedient alliances come first, and despite our [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have joined a religious League that opposes our beliefs. Most advisors see this as a necessity - some of them may even have suggested it.\n\n$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ is not such an advisor. A person of faith, they have hid their outrage at our decision poorly and their attitude is now beginning to impact our international diplomacy. Although we remain loyal to the League, we may find it difficult to retain good relations with its members when we are not only of the wrong faith, but keep such company."
 tyw_events.24.a: "If they can't keep their mouth shut, they must go."
 tyw_events.24.b: "Our allies deserve to hear the truth, even when they don't like it."
 tyw_events.25.t: "[Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Culture.GetName] Question our Rule"
 tyw_events.25.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] have often seen their loyalty to [Root.Owner.GetName] questioned both because of their [Root.Culture.GetName] heritage and because of their refusal to follow the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith. This has led some of them to question whether they belong under the rule of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] at all. Increasingly, they are requesting the right for locals who represent their interests to make decisions on how the province should be ruled. We are reaching a point where some kind of compromise has to be made."
 tyw_events.25.a: "Give power to the [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles in the region."
 tyw_events.25.b: "Give power to those [Root.Culture.GetName] who follow the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith."
 tyw_events.25.c: "Agree to give them the right to rule themselves to some extent."
 tyw_events.26.t: "Jesuit Education for [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tyw_events.26.d: "The Society of Jesus, a congregation more commonly known as by the name of its members, the Jesuits, have offered to provide an education for young [Root.Heir.GetName]. Many relatives and advisors have supported the suggestion, hoping that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will grow up to become, as the Jesuits call themselves, a soldier of God. In these turbulent times, they argue, strength of the spirit is the most important trait of a ruler. Others fear that a people so close to the Church would harden the nascent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s heart to those who stray from its doctrine."
 tyw_events.26.a: "We need a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who can fight for our faith!"
 tyw_events.26.a.tt: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will be raised as a soldier of God, versed in military matters, but harsh on heretics."
 tyw_events.26.b: "We will not allow a religious order to influence our future ruler."
 tyw_events.27.t: "Jesuit-Educated [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ascends to the Throne"
 tyw_events.27.d: "Leaving [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s education to the Jesuits has yielded what most would consider the expected results. The new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not lack conviction or bravery, but is fiercely loyal to the Catholic Church and the Jesuits in particular. The faithful rejoice, but heretics now fear [Root.GetName] more than ever."
 tyw_events.27.a: "Ad maiorem Dei gloriam."
 tyw_events.28.t: "[Root.Culture.GetName] Nobles Flee Abroad"
 tyw_events.28.d: "The war for religious unity in the Holy Roman Empire is not going our way. Our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], by many considered the last safe refuge for those who can make it there, has been taken by the enemy. Now the nobility, both those who resided in the city to begin with and those who fled there, fear that [Root.GetName] is lost and have started to escape to those neighbors who may still house followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith."
 tyw_events.28.a: "Let them flee, and return when [Root.GetName] sees better days."
 tyw_events.28.b: "Bring them to safety within our borders, whatever it takes."
 tyw_events.29.t: "[From.Culture.GetName] Nobles Seek Refuge"
 tyw_events.29.d: "The occupation of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has frightened many among [From.GetName]'s nobility, causing them to flee the country and hoping to find shelter among their fellow followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith here. Since the conflict is religious, at least on the surface, we would be expected to aid those who share our faith. Yet the eyes of the League's enemies are ever upon us, and there are many who would not take kindly to seeing their enemies under our protection."
 tyw_events.29.a: "Surely there are others who can carry this burden."
 tyw_events.29.b: "[Root.Religion.GetName] faithful will always find a haven here."
 tyw_events.30.t: "Íñigo Vélez de Guevara"
 tyw_events.30.d: "Conflicts like our present concerns over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire, although they may seem decided by war, also require diplomatic tact and shrewdness to be won. We happen to have a man at our disposal, the Count of Oñate, who possesses these exact talents. Our enemies in the Empire have neighbors who may very well be interested in knowing that we'd rather see that land in other hands. Merely letting them know could spark a conflict to our advantage."
 tyw_events.30.a: "Send news that [Root.GetName] wish to give them the lands of our enemies."
 tyw_events.30.a.tt: "Offer [This.GetName] a claim on a neighboring HRE nation who opposes on in the Leagues."
 tyw_events.30.b: "His talents are better applied to long-term diplomatic efforts."
 tyw_events.31.t: "[From.GetName] Offers League Enemy"
 tyw_events.31.d: "The allegiance of one of our neighbors, a fellow member of the Empire, appears to have angered [From.GetName]. They have sent an ambassador, a man named Íñigo Vélez de Guevara who appears to have conducted diplomacy in various parts of the Empire, to offer us a claim on the lands of those who have opposed their League.\n\nDire times may be ahead, but dire times are not without opportunities. This is a chance to expand our borders, or alternately to show that we mean our neighbors in the Empire no harm, regardless of League loyalties."
 tyw_events.31.a: "Accept the ambassador's offer."
 tyw_events.31.b: "Let all know that we do not lay claim to this land."
 tyw_events.32.t: "Enforce Sound Toll for Sweden"
 tyw_events.32.d: "The Sound Toll has been an important source of income for Denmark since the early 15th century and has allowed us to wield significant influence over the trade through Øresund since.\n\nSweden has been exempt from the tolls since our countries were united in the Kalmar Union. However, Sweden is no longer under the rule of the Danish crown and has not been for a long time. Perhaps they should start paying the price as well - there is only so much generosity we can show for old time's sake, after all."
 tyw_events.32.a: "We should have removed that exemption long ago."
 tyw_events.32.b: "Traditions like these are what keeps the peace."
 tyw_events.33.t: "Denmark Enforces Sound Toll"
 tyw_events.33.d: "Despite their control of the Sound already giving them a powerful position in Baltic trade, the Danes appear to have let their greed get the better of them. We have been informed that the Sound Toll, which our nation has been exempt from since the days of the Kalmar Union, is now enforced for Swedish ships as well. This is already looking to be a significant annoyance, and some advisors are even suggesting plans for going to war over this grave insult."
 tyw_events.33.a: "Danish devils!"
 tyw_events.34.t: "Request Ottoman Backing to Claim Poland"
 tyw_events.34.d: "We live in a time of possibilities, and our nation has only begun to expand its borders. Born at the edge between the Christian and the Muslim world, with both the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire so close, we must use our connections wisely to persist. Having maintained good diplomatic relations with the Turks, we can leverage their support to prepare an invasion of the Polish lands and claim them for our own."
 tyw_events.34.a: "The time is right. This is our chance."
 tyw_events.34.a.tt: "If the Ottomans agree, we should have claims on neighboring Polish provinces after a week."
 tyw_events.34.b: "Transylvania wishes no harm to the Poles."
 tyw_events.35.t: "Transylvania Requests Backing to Claim Poland"
 tyw_events.35.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName] of Transylvania has sent word that they considering an invasion of Poland. Believing that we'd benefit from seeing their neighbors weakened, they want our implicit support for claiming this land."
 tyw_events.35.a: "An excellent initiative."
 tyw_events.35.b: "We see no point in such a campaign."
 tyw_events.36.t: "Free Hungary from Religious Oppression"
 tyw_events.36.d: "The formation of the Leagues in the Holy Roman Empire have made it clear that we live in a time when nations no longer sit idly by and allow people of their faith to suffer under godless rulers. Not far from our border, Hungarian followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion are in exactly that unacceptable situation. Our nation has strong bonds with Hungary in law and in spirit, and cannot let this continue. It is time for us to free them and reclaim the land, so that [Root.Religion.GetName] blood may never be spilled upon it again."
 tyw_events.36.a: "Transylvania stands with the Hungarians."
 tyw_events.37.t: "Golden Age of Transylvania"
 tyw_events.37.d: "Our nation is seeing perhaps its best era since it was born into its current form. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven to be a highly capable [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and investments are being made to make [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a cultured and impressive city. We hope to spread architecture and education throughout the nation over the coming decade, and pray that this age of peace and prosperity will last."
 tyw_events.37.a: "We will build a nation to last throughout the ages."
 tyw_events.38.t: "United in Prayer"
 tyw_events.38.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], being a [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] of faith, has found an unusually personal way of creating trust and ensuring loyalty. When meeting another [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler in person, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will often ask them to pray together for their common goals. While perhaps forsaking some of the distance sometimes needed in diplomacy, it can create stronger bonds than any formal agreement. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has considered employing this method again on an upcoming visit to a foreign capital, although it is not certain if it will be successful."

 tyw_events.39.t: "God is Spanish"
 tyw_events.39.d: "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going well. The optimism from seeing our efforts to accomplish religious goals has taken on an especially spiritual form, with one of our minister declaring that God is Spanish, fighting for our nation these days. If things continue to go our way, even our enemies may have to admit that there is some truth to this."
 tyw_events.39.a: "What better ally could a soldier ever ask for?"
 tyw_events.40.t: "God Wants Peace"
 tyw_events.40.d: "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going poorly. Since religion is at the core of this conflict, many of those who once claimed that God was with us when we decided to join the League are now claiming that God is depriving us of the means of war and wants us to make peace. Although far from the only interpretation of current events, it has been echoed enough times to increase the doubts that the war can be won."
 tyw_events.40.a: "'Tis a poor faith that increases doubt."
 tyw_events.41.t: "Bartering Increases"
 tyw_events.41.d: "While the poor state of the [Root.GetAdjective] currency is becoming ever more troubling for us, the common people have started to look to other solutions. Many are growing wary of the use of money and avoid it whenever possible, reverting to old means of trade like the barter system. Perhaps their concerns are misplaced, but if we do not act swiftly, we may lose our grip on the economy and the country itself."
 tyw_events.41.a: "Let us just hope this works well for them until we get the problem under control."
 tyw_events.41.b: "Seek the advice of our best economists to stop this by any means."
 tyw_events.42.t: "Capturing the Spanish Treasure Fleet"
 tyw_events.42.d: "Our privateers have long been an annoyance to the Spanish fleets, but a daring plan hatched recently would make us more than just an annoyance. The Spanish Treasure Fleet is departing from the colonies, carrying a cargo of silver, gold and exotic goods worth more than their weight in either. Our privateers plan to intercept these ships in the early stages of their route. They assure us that the cargo can be captured with little risk, and is unlikely to fail unless someone betrays our plan to the Spanish."
 tyw_events.42.a: "Their treasures are better off in [Root.GetAdjective] hands."
 tyw_events.42.b: "We hardly wish to draw the wrath of the Spanish armada."
 tyw_events.43.t: "Spanish Treasure Fleet Captured!"
 tyw_events.43.d: "One by one, the ships of the Spanish Treasure Fleet were intercepted, many of them taken by surprise, some of them trapped, unprepared for us to make such a bold attack. Despite some ships receiving warning beforehand, the cargo from the captured ships will boost our economy for months, if not years. The privateers have returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as heroes. We are unlikely to ever see such a successful capture again."
 tyw_events.43.a: "Yet it was a joy to see it once."
 tyw_events.44.t: "Treasure Fleet Captured by the Dutch"
 tyw_events.44.d: "The Dutch privateers who have long plagued our efforts to get trade goods home from distant colonies recently made a direct attack on our Treasure Fleet just as it was leaving for the Spanish ports to bring silver and gold back to our homeland. Although some ships were prepared and managed to avoid the assault, the ones who did not cost us dearly. It has not yet been decided how or what the Dutch will pay for this, but they will certainly pay."
 tyw_events.44.a: "Gold, silver and blood would all be acceptable currencies."
 tyw_events.45.t: "An Educated [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tyw_events.45.d: "The education [Root.Monarch.GetName] had growing up during the regency has prepared [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to rule as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], just as we hoped. The advisors who provided it are proud of having left such a lasting legacy in the wisdom and motives of the [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] who will rule [Root.GetName]."
 tyw_events.45.a: "They should be."
 tyw_events.46.t: "Victory at [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]!"
 tyw_events.46.d: "The League war has brought us all the way to the capital of one of our enemies. Striking at the heart of their nation, we were victorious, to their great shame. Among the many skilled soldiers involved, one in particular has been praised for contributing to the victory and has been promoted to the position of general after showing exceptional calm and quick thinking during the mayhem."
 tyw_events.46.a: "He may strike fear into the hearts of more nations yet."
 tyw_events.47.t: "Preparing our Defenses"
 tyw_events.47.d: "[Root.GetName] is under attack, but the enemy has so far not advanced very far into our lands. Our army strategists suggest that we fortify our defenses where they are needed the most. They are, however, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for an opinion on exactly where that would be. It is certainly true that we cannot afford to lose control of our capital but it may still be best to fortify our borders first."
 tyw_events.47.a: "Focus on preparing the capital and its surrounding provinces."
 tyw_events.47.b: "Fortifications must start at points on our borders."
 tyw_events.48.t: "True Intentions"
 tyw_events.48.d: "While the League war was started for religious reasons, the religious allegiance of the Holy Roman Empire is not the only concern of the members. Some see the war as a chance to claim land from some of those on the opposing side, considering the religious goals of the leaders to be secondary, if not a pretense entirely.\n\nRecently, we have been confronted by ambassadors from the leader of our League, who implores us to make our real motives clear for the benefit of future peace negotiations."
 tyw_events.48.a: "We hope to finish this war with more land and make no secret of this."
 tyw_events.48.b: "[Root.GetName] fights for the cause of faith itself!"
 tyw_events.49.t: "[From.GetName] Claims to Fight for Land"
 tyw_events.49.d: "While the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith may be crucial for us, some members of the League are not so noble in their intentions. An ambassador recently returned from [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] with word from the [From.GetAdjective], who admitted that what they really hope to gain from this war is expansion of their borders. Unpleasant news, weakening the strength of our cooperation and position to negotiate peace."
 tyw_events.49.a: "At least they are honest in their selfishness."
 tyw_events.50.t: "[From.GetName] Claims to Fight for Faith"
 tyw_events.50.d: "Not all of the League joined our side to fight for the [Root.Religion.GetName] cause. Many have simply chosen our side because it is politically expedient. Word from [From.GetName], however, is that they truly care about our plight and see the League as a religious alliance first and foremost, and go into battle knowing that they are doing God's work by our side."
 tyw_events.50.a: "Let us hope they remain true to such a noble ideal."

While $MONARCH$ is an immensely popular $MONARCHTITLE$ a durable state should not be built on personal loyalties alone. The road forward must be to unify our people through a common religious identity different from that of our neighbors.\nWhile far from all of our subjects would identify as Shia currently there are many cases of Shiite customs, such as the honoring of the Imams, being practiced by the Muslims of Persia. By ensuring that our people all adhere to Twelver Shiism we can create a Persian identity which will stand the test of time."

The perpetrators are a group of Siddis, former slaves of Ethiopian origin that have become a quite common sight in the navies and armies of this region.\nThe leader of the Siddis has sent an emissary to our court today, asking that we allow them to stay in control of the fort that they have taken in return for their loyal service to our state."

Ever since the last remaining heir of the Rathore lineage has been wandering the deserts of Rajasthan biding his time and waiting for an opportunity to reclaim his patrimony.\nThat time seems to have finally come, at least in the mind of Jodha Rathore.

The marriage was to become a quite short affair, however, as the young princess was widowed a few years later.\nAs a widow, Mira Bai has become increasingly devoted to Krishna and has been seen wandering the streets of the capital singing and dancing with others of a similarly strong faith. The fact that this behavior is far from fitting for a royal widow has led to some ill will within the royal family.

It is what propelled our ancestors from mere governors of the east (Malik-us-Sharq) to Sultans in their own right. Since that day we have watched with great interest as the Delhi Sultanate has gradually been torn apart by inner struggles and claimants with outside support, using every opportunity to slowly eat away at their control over northern India.\nDelhi's situation is now worse than ever and as yet another power hungry local strongman marches on the capital an increasing stream of Delhian nobles and officials pour over our borders seeking new employment and offering to help us secure what remains of the Delhian lands."

The Delhi sultans in their day further fortified the place using materials from many of the buildings of the defeated Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.\nWith the advent of our independent Sultanate in the late 14th century the fort was further strengthened and began to serve as a royal residence.

Our vizier has therefore suggested that we, like the Delhi sultans before us, create a specific tax on all pilgrims that would visit the holy places in our lands. In place such a tax would undoubtedly bring us a steady income, but it would not be a very popular policy among our non-Muslim subjects."

The Jaunpuris would take the matter into their own hands and want to conduct a punitive expedition against Kalpi.\nWhile we have also heard rumors of the state of affairs in Kalpi this is a decision to consider carefully, Kalpi is an old contested zone between Jaunpur and Malwa and it does not seem unlikely that the Jaunpuris might have bigger plans than they let on."

 flavor_mlc.1.t: "The Plot against Raja Ibrahim"
 flavor_mlc.1.d: "The religious balance in an as cosmopolitan state as Malacca can be a very fragile thing. In our state traders of many religions and cultures live side by side yet still keep apart to a certain extent. The biggest communities, those of the Gujaratis, Tamils, Javanese and Chinese all have their own respective obligations to the state and keeping the influence of these groups in balance is one of the most important tasks of any Malaccan monarch.\nThe ascension of Raja Ibrahim in 1444 has therefore ruffled quite a few feathers. Ibrahim was a practicing Hindu and came to be seen by many as a traditionalist aiming to roll back the influence of Islam in our country. It still came as a big surprise when the young king was found dead in his palace today. Many suspect that his prime minister, the royal Bendahara, must've had a hand in this but little can be proven."

Nonetheless a royal Bendahara that would plot against his liege is a frightening thing and we would be wise to replace this minister or risk meeting the same fate as his last master.

 flavor_mlc.4.d: "Malacca has in many ways been the center of the Islamization of the Malay archipelago. Our state itself has, however, always avoided any stern or overly orthodox varieties of Islamic law in favor of keeping it an attractive spot for traders of all nationalities. Instead tradition is relied upon to be the law of the land while orthodox Islamic laws have been reserved for special cases, often related to keeping the public order. While this has upset some of those with more delicate religious sensibilities over the years it has been good for trade and has therefore been supported the Malaccan communities.\nOver time, however, Muslims have become more and more dominant in our state and due to its importance for the spread of Islam among the islands some have even begun to consider Malacca a pilgrimage site. Perhaps the time has come to introduce a bit more orthodoxy in the laws and customs of our state?"

Despite this our kingdom is flourishing and ships from all over Asia come to our docks to sell, buy and resell all kinds of goods.\nIn order to further encourage trade the royal Bendahara has suggested that we lower customs and duties to almost nothing. This bold policy would set us apart even from other trade oriented kingdoms and would in his opinion secure our place as the greatest emporium of the East."

When all the Bendahara's own guards had fled this man and his friends acted quickly and valiantly to save our minister. Moved by this deep loyalty to the state the Bendahara immediately appointed the young warrior, Hang Tuah, to the post of royal commander.\nOur kingdom has now gained the service of one of its greatest champions."

 flavor_mlc.7.d: "Ships from distant shores is no rare thing in Malacca yet today an unusual visitor arrived in our city. The captain presents himself as coming from a Christian kingdom far to the west known as Portugal and wants to sign a trade agreement by which his country would become one of the most favored trading partners of our state.\nThe Muslim Gujarati community, however, is propagating very strongly that the man is dangerous and that his country is a sworn enemy to our religion. The Gujaratis are so vehemently opposed to Portuguese presence here that they have already begun to act with open hostility towards the newcomers, confiscating their goods and boarding their ships. There is a risk that this could get out of hand very quickly..."

 flavor_ori.3.d: "After a long life the great warrior king Kapilendra lies on his deathbed. To the shock of his 18 legitimate sons, however, the old king, guided by the voice of Jagannath, has elected to make his illegitimate son Purushottama his heir.\nAs the king draws his last breath the royal succession is far from assured as Hamvira, the favorite candidate until this date, has fled to the south where he has taken up arms against Purushottama."
 flavor_ori.3.a: "We must follow the will of Jagannath!"
 flavor_ori.3.b: "Hamvira is the rightful heir!"
 flavor_ori.3.a.tt: "Our neighbors will learn of this and react accordingly."
 flavor_ori.4.t: "Succession Crisis in Orissa"
 flavor_ori.4.d: "Word has reached us that Kapilendra, the warrior king of Orissa, is dead and it seems his sons are fighting for his throne, leaving the kingdom weak and exposed."
 flavor_ori.4.a: "Ok."
 flavor_ori.5.t: "Hamvira's Offer"
 flavor_ori.5.d: "A messenger arrived today from Hamvira, a contender for the throne of Orissa. If we support him in his struggle to secure the throne of Orissa for himself Hamvira claims he will grant us a number of important forts in the east."
 flavor_ori.5.a: "Send troops and money."
 flavor_ori.5.b: "Avoid getting involved."
 flavor_ori.6.t: "The Bahmanis back Hamvira."
 flavor_ori.6.d: "The Bahmani sultan, an old enemy of our kingdom, has decided to back Hamvira. We can't know for sure what he has been promised but if rumors are to be believed Hamvira has been desperate enough to promise the Bahmanis a large part of our country."
 flavor_ori.6.a: "Best make sure he doesn't win then."
 flavor_ori.7.t: "Hamvira victorious"
 flavor_ori.7.d: "As the armies of Hamvira, the pretender, take control of the capital the civil war seems to be coming to an end. In the south the Bahmani sultan has acted quickly by sending troops to garrison the new forts that they have been promised."
 flavor_ori.7.a: "This isn't good."
 flavor_ori.8.t: "Hamvira pays his debts."
 flavor_ori.8.d: "With the civil war in Orissa coming to an end we have now managed to take control over the areas promised to us by Hamvira."
 flavor_ori.8.a: "Great!"
 flavor_ori.9.t: "The Jagannath Cult"
 flavor_ori.9.d: "With the departure of the Gajapatis from the throne of Orissa the close bond between the state and Jagannath and his priests has been cut. While the temple in Puri and the worship of this deity himself remain important to the cultural and spiritual life of Orissa it is no longer as closely tied to the monarchy itself."
 flavor_ori.9.a: "Ok."
 flavor_ori.10.t: "Birth of Oriya Literature"
 flavor_ori.10.d: "Up until now Sanskrit has been the only language of literature in Orissa, with the colloquial Oriya language being reserved for the Shudras and lower castes. Sarala Das, a retired soldier with little formal education has begun to change this, however, by translating the Mahabharata into Oriya. Sarala Das' original work is also exclusively in Oriya and other poets have now begun to take up this practice."
 flavor_ori.10.a: "Ok."
 flavor_ori.11.t: "Achyutananda"
 flavor_ori.11.d: "A poet, seer and prolific author has been gaining popularity as a Vaisnava saint in our kingdom. Achyutananda is said to be able to foretell the future and his books are written in Oriya, the language of the people."

 desc_zan_religious_unrest: "In order to placate the many foreign traders in our state we have begun to weed out unorthodox religious practices. While this may be to our advantage in the long run it is currently undermining the legitimacy of our own dynasty, which is rooted in these traditions, and creating tensions between the many religious groups in our state at the same time."

 desc_zan_kilwa_chronicle: "The Chronicle of Kilwa is a book that records the history of our dynasty from its origins before arriving in Kilwa up until the present day. It is a document that proves our legitimate right to rule the ports of the Swahili coast without a shadow of a doubt."
 flavor_zan.1.t: "Shirazi Islam and the Patricians of Kilwa"
 flavor_zan.1.d: "Most of the Swahili states are to this day ruled by dynasties that claim to be descended from the first Islamic migration into this region. The Islam practiced by these 'Shirazis', as they call themselves, is, however, not the most orthodox form of the religion. Many older local ceremonies are performed daily in our court and the Shirazi lineages are considered to have magical abilities that give them the right to rule these cities.\nAs the wealth of Kilwa and the other Swahili states grows, however, new waves of foreigners continue to arrive in great numbers. Traders from Oman, Persia, the Bahmani kingdom and other faraway lands have made our cities their home and a rising class of indigenous merchants has made these groups their partners. Many of the newcomers are abhorred by our traditions. If we would adopt a more orthodox form of Islam this would certainly help our relations with the other states of the Indian Ocean, but there is a very real risk that it would undermine our own rule and hurt relations with the other Swahili states."
 flavor_zan.1.a: "We must follow the ways of our ancestors."
 flavor_zan.1.b: "Let us purge our kingdom of pagan beliefs and ceremonies."
 flavor_zan.2.t: "The Kilwa Chronicle"
 flavor_zan.2.d: "With more and more foreign traders arriving in the Swahili coast from orthodox Islamic states our old Shirazi ways have come more and more under fire. We have watched with disgust as some of the old Shirazi dynasties of the Swahili coast have been overthrown by a rising class of indigenous traders allied with the newcomers.\nAs one of the oldest and most powerful Shirazi dynasties, however, we still stand strong. In order to suitably impress foreigners and domestic troublemakers alike it might be best if we assigned our scribes to create a chronicle over our famous lineage, so that none may doubt our Shirazi origin and the old Islamic roots of our dynasty."
 flavor_zan.2.a: "Let us create such a Chronicle."
 flavor_zan.2.b: "We have more important matters to attend."
 flavor_zan.3.t: "Abandoning Shirazi traditions"
 flavor_zan.3.d: "In the process of reforming the religious establishment of our kingdom we have come to the point where we will need to make a choice in regards to which tradition we should try to emulate. Our kingdom is home to Persian Shiites, Ibadi traders from Oman as well as Indian and Turkish Sunni traders. Apart from theological considerations the form of Islam we will associate with is likely to shape the foreign policy of our kingdom for years to come."
 flavor_zan.3.a: "Our current reforms have been enough."
 flavor_zan.3.b: "Let us embrace Shiism."
 flavor_zan.3.c: "Let us align with the Ibadis."
 flavor_zan.3.od: "We should invite Sunni scholars to help reform our kingdom."
 flavor_zan.4.t: "Cannibals!"
 flavor_zan.4.d: "While our kingdom owes its entire existence to the Indian-Ocean trade network and holds very little real control over the African inland we must always be on our guard for the people of the interior. One such group, the cannibalistic Zimba, have been spreading fear along the coast far to our south. With little warning the Zimba suddenly descended on the city of Kilwa itself today. Many Kilwan citizens are now dead and even more have fled the city. It will take years for Kilwa to recover, we can scarcely remember a greater tragedy in the history of our kingdom."
 flavor_zan.4.a: "A day of sorrow."
 flavor_zan.4.b: "Use all resources to rebuild and restore Kilwa."
 flavor_zan.5.t: "Coup of Suleiman and Muhammad al-Mazlum"
 flavor_zan.5.d: "When Sultan Ismâ'îl ascended the throne of Kilwa in 1442 his rule was questioned by the local rulers in Zanzibar who supported his relative Said's bid to become sultan. Said's plot was, however, thwarted by the royal vizier Suleiman and the emir Muhammad al-Mazlum.\nWith the passing of Ismâ'îl himself, however, it seems Suleiman and Muhammad have decided that the time has come for them to rule in their own name. Acting quickly they have used their influence to secure the capital for themselves and have agreed to share power by taking the throne in turns."
 flavor_zan.5.a: "Suleiman takes the throne."
 flavor_zan.5.b: "Muhammad al-Muzlum takes the throne."
 flavor_zan.5.c: "$MONARCH$ is our rightful ruler!"
 flavor_zan.6.t: "Unpopular Coupmaker"
 flavor_zan.6.d: "While $MONARCH$ had served as minister of the throne in many years before usurping power directly his coup has made him unpopular among the citizens of Kilwa. Prominent citizens are now demanding his resignation and unless placated we may have a revolt on our hands sooner or later."
 flavor_zan.6.a: "Abdicate in favor of $HEIR$"
 flavor_zan.6.b: "Our ruler has won the right to this throne."
 flavor_zan.7.t: "Plotting Vizier"
 flavor_zan.7.d: "Holding on to the Kilwan throne has never been easy and with the great number of plots surrounding the coronation of monarchs over the last decades the post of Vizier in the royal government has become one sought by ambitious men wanting the throne for themselves rather than loyal administrators eager to serve the crown.\nThe faltering popularity of the monarchy lately was apparently all that our current Vizier needed to attempt to secure the throne for himself."

 flavor_ful.1.d: "Marabout preachers inspired by the charismatic Nasir al-din have begun propagating for an Islamic reformation in $PROVINCENAME$. Many local warriors have joined with the Marabout and together they are now working outside of the state to create a society here following the Sharia in its purest form. They are violently opposed to any pagan traditions or foreign influences."

 flavor_ful.2.t: "Orthodox Islamic Revolution"
 flavor_ful.2.d: "Religious tensions have been slowly rising in our country since the rise of the Marabouts in the middle of the 17th century. Now the Marabout faction in $COUNTRYNAME$ have come out in open revolt against the old aristocracy in $CAPITAL_CITY$. The promised revolution has quickly gotten the support of many of the Fulani herdsmen that are present in large parts of our state and it is clear that we will soon have a very serious revolt on our hands."

 flavor_sok.1.t: "Usman dan Fodio"
 flavor_sok.1.d: "Inspired by the Fulani religious revolutions, Usman dan Fodio, a Fulani Muslim scholar in Gobir, has begun agitating for reform in our country. His strong message and his charismatic person has impressed parts of our population and a growing movement now supports the creation of a Caliphate governed by orthodox Islamic traditions, adherence to the Sharia and the mission to spread the true faith in West Africa.\nThe message is also quite critical of the current way our state is run and the authorities in Gobir fear that Usman Dan Fodio's followers might soon openly revolt against our rule."

 flavor_kbo.1.d: "Ever since the 14th century, there have been two branches of the Sayfawa dynasty fighting for the throne of our kingdom. As neither branch has been powerful enough to defeat the other entirely, the Idrisid and Dawudid lines have come take short turns on the throne. Some rulers have not even lasted a year. This conflict has gone on for far too long and by now our ministers and governors are all playing kingmakers while the kingdom burns.\nWith the death of our $MONARCHTITLE$, the usual disputed succession has taken place with a pretender taking up arms against the royal heir."

 flavor_kbo.3.t: "Enforcing Islamic Orthodoxy"
 flavor_kbo.3.d: "While our Islamic Sultanate is one of the older in this region it is even among the upper classes an unorthodox and syncretic religion. Inspired by the many learned men who come to our capital $MONARCH$ has been considering if we should start a purge of the religious syncretism, especially among the aristocracy and the members of the royal dynasty. As the Dawudid line gets some of their support from heathens we can only hope that this will perhaps also lessen the political instability of our country."

 ambrosian_republic.1.d: "The establishment of the Golden Ambrosian Republic was not without its troubles, but liberty has prevailed at last. We did not fall back into the darkness of feudalism, nor did we descend into military tyranny. Peace, justice, and liberty reign throughout [Root.GetName]."
 ambrosian_republic.1.d2: "The establishment of the Golden Ambrosian Republic was not without its troubles. In our desperation we abandoned our ideals of liberty and granted absolute power to our Captain General. May [Root.Monarch.GetName] protect the peace for many years to come."
 ambrosian_republic.1.d3: "The Golden Ambrosian Republic was an experiment doomed to failure. The lofty ideals of its scholarly founders proved to be unworkable, and the people cried out for the return of a Duke. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has seized the throne and restored the natural order to [Root.GetName]."
 ambrosian_republic.1.d4: "The Golden Ambrosian Republic was an experiment doomed to failure. In the absence of a Duke, the savvy lords of [Root.Overlord.GetName] seized the opportunity to claim the vacant throne of [Root.GetName] for themselves. May [Root.Monarch.GetName] rule us with wisdom and patience."
 ambrosian_republic.1.a: "Praise Saint Ambrose!"
 ambrosian_republic.2.t: "The Milanese Succession"
 ambrosian_republic.2.d: "With the throne of [Root.GetName] left vacant, both the [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of France and the Emperor are openly discussing their claims to the Duchy. The French claim is predicated on marriages ties to the old Visconti dynasty. Though the claim is not strong, France has had designs on Italy for quite some time and there are few with the strength to resist the [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Emperor meanwhile contends that in the absence of a clear heir, the title of Duke is to be conferred upon the Emperor by Imperial law."
 ambrosian_republic.2.a: "We must be prepared to defend our liberty."
 ambrosian_republic.3.d: "Milan has fallen into political chaos. The throne is vacant and an upstart Republic strives in vain to establish order. This would be an excellent time to enforce our claim to the Duchy of Milan, predicated on our marriage ties to the now extinct House of Visconti."
 ambrosian_republic.3.a: "The throne belongs to us!"
 ambrosian_republic.3.b: "We have no interest in Milan"
 ambrosian_republic.4.d: "Milan has fallen into political chaos. The throne is vacant and an upstart Republic strives in vain to establish order. By Imperial law, the title of Duke ought to pass to the Emperor [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] when the line of Dukes is extinguished. If we wish to impose this law and claim Milan for ourselves, we must act quickly to depose the so-called Golden Ambrosian Republic."
 ambrosian_republic.5.t: "A Proposition for Sforza"
 ambrosian_republic.5.d: "Francesco Sforza is one of the greatest military generals of our times, and a prominent condottieri leader. It is most unfortunate that we find ourselves at odds with him in our war against Venice. Sforza is popular among the Milanese people however, and even has a claim to the throne.\n\nA faction within the divided government have written to Sforza with a generous offer; if he abandons our enemies and joins our cause, Milan would offer him the province of [sforza_promised_province.GetName] as well as a position as a Captain and Defender. Sforza could be a great asset to the Republic, but many question whether his loyalty to Milan will trump his personal ambition."
 ambrosian_republic.5.d2: "Francesco Sforza is one of the greatest military generals of our times, and a prominent condottieri leader. It is most unfortunate that we find ourselves at odds with him in our war against [sforza_origin_country.GetName]. Sforza is popular among the Milanese people however, and even has a claim to the throne.\n\nA faction within the divided government have written to Sforza with a generous offer; if he abandons our enemies and joins our cause, Milan would offer him the province of [sforza_promised_province.GetName] as well as a position as a Captain and Defender. Sforza could be a great asset to the Republic, but many question whether his loyalty to Milan will trump his personal ambition."
 ambrosian_republic.5.d3: "Francesco Sforza is one of the greatest military generals of our times, and a prominent condottieri leader. It is most unfortunate that we find ourselves at odds with him in our struggles to suppress rebellion. Sforza is popular among the Milanese people however, and even has a claim to the throne.\n\nA faction within the divided government have written to Sforza with a generous offer; if he abandons our enemies and joins our cause, Milan would offer him the province of [sforza_promised_province.GetName] as well as a position as a Captain and Defender. Sforza could be a great asset to the Republic, but many question whether his loyalty to Milan will trump his personal ambition."
 ambrosian_republic.5.a: "We shall appoint him commander of our armies."
 ambrosian_republic.5.b: "We don't need Sforza."
 ambrosian_republic.6.t: "Sforza Clashes with the Republic"
 ambrosian_republic.6.d: "Sforza has many rivals within the Golden Ambrosian Republic. The more idealistic and scholarly politicians who founded the Republic suspect him of conspiring to seize the throne, while more pragmatic politicians resent his popularity among the people.\n\nSforza has recently learned of a plot to deprive him of his military command and eject him from his position in government. Outraged, Sforza issues an ultimatum to the state"
 ambrosian_republic.6.a: "Impose military rule under Sforza."
 ambrosian_republic.6.b: "Resist Sforza's tyranny. We fight for liberty!"
 ambrosian_republic.7.t: "Sforza Seizes the Throne"
 ambrosian_republic.7.d: "Ever the ambitious opportunist, Sforza has betrayed the Republic and declared himself the rightful Duke of Milan! His popularity with the people and iron grip over both the army and the mechanisms of state make defiance to his rule seem like a doomed prospect. Perhaps we must accept the return of the monarchy. Or perhaps liberty is worth any price."

On the 25th of September 1555, Karl signed the Augsburger Reichs- und Religionsfrieden - the imperial and religious peace treaty, which provided religious unity within the state.

 liberte_reform: "Liberté Ideals"
 liberte_reform_desc: "Liberté is the school of thought within the Revolution that claims that any individual should have the divine right to do whatever he or she wishes that does not do harm to or restrict the liberty of others."
 egalite_reform: "Egalité Ideals"
 egalite_reform_desc: "Those who believe in the ideals of Egalité believe that the law, whether it be a rule or a right, applies equally to all people, regardless of faith, social class, culture, and gender. Equally, all citizens should have access to all positions in our government based only on their competence."
 fraternite_reform: "Fraternité Ideals"
 fraternite_reform_desc: "Not everyone acknowledges the ideals of Fraternité as an ideal of the Revolution, but view it as a reactionary element within our own state who wish to return to the old government. Fraternité is a sense of brotherhood and those who follow its principles believe that the state should follow an authoritarian route where there is a proper place for all citizens assigned by the state."
 legislative_assembly_reform: "Legislative Assembly"
 legislative_assembly_reform_desc: "With the collapse of the old government, we have an opportunity to reconstruct a new legislative government which treats all people, regardless of social class, as equals. This government shall be absolutely committed to the ideals of the Revolution, and will not suffer those who wish to subjugate us back into the old regime."
 national_constituent_reform: "Constituent Assembly"
 national_constituent_reform_desc: "The Constituent Assembly was a rough outline of democracy provided by the old government that governed the people in three distinct constituents. By building and expanding upon the old government rather than overhauling it with the new, we may prove to the reactionary governments on our border that we are still a civilized nation and a force for good in this changing world."
 feuillant_reform: "The Feuillant System"
 feuillant_reform_desc: "There are many citizens and politicians in the Republic who wish to return to the tyranny of an absolute monarchy. However, the Feuillant political group believe in a compromise; that powers in the nation should be split between an Emperor and a President, similar to a constitutional monarchy. By riding the delicate balance between Empire and Republic, we may actually please both the Imperialists and Republicans within our nation."
 two_chamber_reform: "The Two-Chamber System"
 two_chamber_reform_desc: "For a long time, the Canton system maintained the peace, stability, and independence of small democratic leagues like the Swiss and Swabian Federations. By similarly dividing our legislature into a Grand Council representing the Cantons, and the Senate representing the republic as a whole, we may protect the interests of the individual cities and cultural identities within our nation while still placing the values of the Revolution above all else!"
 absolute_president_reform: "Absolute Power of the President"
 absolute_president_reform_desc: "While we have members of our nation elected to represent the people of their constituency, we must never forget that it is the President who has been elected to represent all people. The role of the elected representatives within the Revolution should be merely to advise the President who wields absolute power over the Republic."
 revolutionary_council_reform: "A Revolutionary Council"
 revolutionary_council_reform_desc: "It’s become clear that the cult of personality surrounding our ruler is rapidly returning us to the old ways of government. We cannot allow this to happen, so by concentrating power into a council of elected individuals to represent the values of the Revolution, we strip power away from the individual at our state’s head and create another shield against the horror of absolute rulership."
 revolutionary_principle_reform: "Revolutionary Principle"
 revolutionary_principle_reform_desc: "The purpose of our state is quite simple; to spread the Revolution. We must centralise our state around the idea that it is only be liberating all people of the world into Revolutionary states that we may create an everlasting state of peace and equality in the world."
 equality_principle_reform: "Equality Principle"
 equality_principle_reform_desc: "Although our state holds Egalité as one of its core values, it is clear that we have completely failed in our goal to treat all our people with fairness and equality. The core principle of our nation must be to eliminate the barriers of gender, culture, and social class and ensure that it is known that all people are created equal and a good start to that would be to ensure that religion remains a private matter and does not dictate one’s rights within the state."
 imperial_principle_reform: "Imperial Principle"
 imperial_principle_reform_desc: "The Revolution has made it clear that our nation, above all others, wields the divine right to hold Imperial Hegemony over all other nations. The states around us are fragile and weak, and it is clear that only by directly controlling these states ourselves will we ensure that the values of the Revolution are enforced on the people."
 equal_electorate_reform: "Equal Electorate"
 equal_electorate_reform_desc: "We must dissolve all barriers that separate our people and extend the right to hold a political office to all people. Gender, religion, social class, culture, all are irrelevant to one’s capability to hold a political office and so we must strive to maintain equality of opportunity within our government."
 three_classes_reform: "Three Social Classes"
 three_classes_reform_desc: "In the days before the birth of the Revolution, the old government attempted to sway the people away from taking arms by allowing three social classes representation within the government; the clergy, the peasants, and the upper class. Perhaps we could emulate this system by organizing our people into an upper, middle, and lower class based on their economic status and creating three distinct political entities within our government to represent their interests."
 military_electorate_reform: "Military Electorate"
 military_electorate_reform_desc: "Our nation values comradery above all else, and nobody exemplifies the value of being a comrade like our boys fighting on the fields of battle. These are the men who’ve seen the horrors of war and fought alongside their countrymen to preserve and advance the Revolution, and these men should be the ones to rule us. We must alter the requirements to hold an office in our government so that only those who have served in our military are eligible to represent the people within the government."
 president_for_life_reform: "President For Life"
 president_for_life_reform_desc: "Though many Revolutionary politicians are supporting the idea of a Revolutionary Empire with a hereditary ruler at its head, others are fiercely resisting this idea and claiming that it betrays the very ideals of the Revolution itself. The President is sovereign, and none may supersede the authority of the Presidency. By electing our Presidents to rule for life, we will both secure the absolute leadership the Imperialists demand without completely abandoning the ideals of the Republic."
 government_for_people_reform: "Government for the People"
 government_for_people_reform_desc: "Egalité, Fraternité, Liberté. All three virtues of the Republic point to one thing; that the Republic exists to serve its people, and for no other reason. We will never surrender to the Imperialists, and the President shall always serve his term with the singular focus of protecting the freedom and equality of our people."

 become_rev_empire_reform_desc: "Even in a Republic fueled by the fires of Revolution, it’s becoming clear that political dynasties are being established in our nation.

 legion_of_honor_reform_desc: "Now that we have reorganized the revolution into a hereditary Empire, we must enlist our most famous contrymen to legitimize our Imperial rule. The Legion of Honor shall be an order of Knights, Officers, and Commanders granted positions of great prestige by the Imperial Court."
 imperial_nobility_reform: "Nobility of the Emperor"
 imperial_nobility_reform_desc: "With the majority of the old Nobility of our nation now buried headless in mass graves, the time has come to re-establish our Nobility in a structure more amiable to the Empire’s goals. By assigning noble titles almost entirely to loyalists and members of the Imperial family, we will ensure that the Nobility will never act outside of the interests of the Crown."
 imperial_decree_reform: "Imperial Decree"
 imperial_decree_reform_desc: "The Emperor rules supreme in this nation and disloyalty to the Emperor is equivalent to disloyalty to the Revolution. All decrees issued by the Empire are of course done so in the interest of the people, the Revolution, and the Empire, and disloyalty shall not go unpunished."
 consulate_reform: "A Loyal Consulate"
 consulate_reform_desc: "With the fall of the republican government within the Revolution, it soon became clear that a new system was necessary to continue the spread of the revolution. The Consulate filled that void, and perhaps by advancing the powers of the Consulate and liberally dismissing any who object to the Emperor’s rule we will solidify our grasp on all of our Imperial holdings."
 emperor_of_the_revolution_reform: "Emperor of the Revolution"
 emperor_of_the_revolution_reform_desc: "Our state is the home of the Revolution, and our Emperor is its head. It is only natural then that we coronate our Emperor as the Emperor of all those loyal to the Revolution and rally the people around his divine cause."
 enlightened_monarchy_reform: "An Enlightened Monarchy"
 enlightened_monarchy_reform_desc: "The ideals of the Enlightenment are the very foundation for Revolutionary thought, and as long as our Emperor does not truly embrace the ideals of the Enlightenment then he does not represent the values of the Revolution. Many would say a hereditary monarchy itself betrays the ideals of the Revolution, but a combination of an absolute monarch and Enlightenment thought shall ensure that none can oppose the ideals of our state."
 become_rev_republic_reform: "Return to the Revolutionary Republic"
 become_rev_republic_reform_desc: "The Empire has served its purpose of advancing the needs of the people through an absolute government. Now that our mission is complete, we should hand our powers back to the people we have fought so hard to liberate and allow them to choose their own destiny."
 consolidate_power_in_cities_reform: "Disperse Power Across the Cities"
 consolidate_power_in_cities_reform_desc: "Our government is a strange mix between a Republic, an Oligarchy, and a Monarchy. Trade and commerce are our primary concern and we’re not interested in building a global empire, only making an empire of trade. If we shatter powers in our nation and grant greater control to the Trade Cities, we shall make our trade league much more inviting for the smaller powers who only desire the freedom and economic stability that we can provide."
 consolidate_power_in_doge_reform: "Consolidate Power in the Doge"
 consolidate_power_in_doge_reform_desc: "For years, our Republic has had its power base divided between the Doge, the Council of Ten, the citizens, and countless other legislative bodies. Each are subject to each other, but the Doge sits at the top of the hierarchy. Our loose government system has been useful thus far in advancing our trade efforts, but as our nation expands across the world, it’s become clear that we must grant the Doge executive powers across all branches of the government if we are to eliminate corruption in our administration."

 ttl_league_system: "The League System"
 ttl_league_system_desc: "Our state is a decentralized federation of Leagues, all united in their goal for neutrality and peace. We wish not to bloody our soil with the blood of foreign men, and to instead allow foreign men to bloody each other while we collect the profits. As such, it is vital that the Cantons within our nation are able to maintain positive relations with all nearby nations. However, this decentralized style of rule may prove difficult to maintain as our nation expands."
 ttl_gods_house: "The League of God's House"
 ttl_gods_house_desc: "God's House is a league of powerful bishops and Cantons united in their goal to resist the Bishopric of Chur and the rising power of the Habsburg princes within our nation. The primary concern of this league is to ensure that the Cantons remain out of Habsburg hands and stays faithful to the one true word of God."
 ttl_grey_league: "The Grey League"
 ttl_grey_league_desc: "This league was born out of conflict and strove to mitigate and end it wherever possible. The league was formed when many of the nearby counts, barons, and bishops began to grow increasingly hostile. The Grey League brought an end to these hostilities and continues to keep all Cantons within it out of direct conflict with foreign powers."
 ttl_league_of_ten: "The League of Ten"
 ttl_league_of_ten_desc: "When the dynasty of Toggenburg became extinct, the ten districts of Toggenburg united together into a single league so that they may continue to enjoy their independence. The League of Ten joined the Three Leagues so they would not be forced back into the servitude of a Count, hence the spirit of our independent way of life lives most vibrantly in The League of Ten."
 ttl_independent_cities: "Independent Cities"
 ttl_independent_cities_desc: "The Three Leagues is not a nation; rather it is a federation of cities, bishoprics, and Cantons united together in their desire to remain independent. As such, the league itself demands very little in form of tribute from its member states, but equally the member states expect little contribution back."
 ttl_economic_league: "An Economic League"
 ttl_economic_league_desc: "As well as coming together in times of war, the Three Leagues also met to secure their economic co-operation as well. By coordinating mercenary contracts in times of war and trade agreements in times of peace, the leagues were able to maximize profit whether the world around them was prospering in peace or burning in war."
 ttl_expanding_league: "Expanding the Leagues"
 ttl_expanding_league_desc: "It has become clear that our way of life is greatly threatened by the other powers in Europe. Our independence and neutrality will not be respected if we do not have the power to enforce it. It is only by expanding the league to include more independent nations that we may continue to enjoy our shared autonomy."
 teutonic_legacy: "Legacy of the Teutonic Knights"
 teutonic_legacy_desc: "Though our state is fully secularized now, we must never forget that it was built on the remains of the Teutonic Order. These knights, united in their faith, established themselves here in Prussia to defend the Christian world from the barbaric pagans to the East, and we too should make it our duty to spread the reformation to all corners of our nation and become united in the true teachings of Christ!"
 soldier_king: "The Soldier-King of Prussia"
 soldier_king_desc: "Most states are countries that have an army, Prussia on the other hand is an army that has a country. The many Kings of Prussia were as much soldiers as they were Monarchs, and each would end their reign not only having reformed the state but also having left their mark on the army."

 northern_march_desc: "In the early days of the Empire, the Brandenburg area was settled and governed by Slavic tribes, until the Emperor created the Northern March to subjugate and civilize the area. This Northern March eventually evolved into Brandenburg; one of the most prosperous regions in the Empire. It is only due to the fortitude of our soldiers that we were able to tame and secure this land of savages."

 bra_pomeranian_wars_desc: "Throughout the entire medieval era, the Margraves of Brandenburg and the Dukes of Pomerania found themselves in constant war for control of the region.

 seat_of_the_old_emperors_desc: "Before Habsburg rule, the empire was truly diverse in the families it elected, and Brandenburg was often a great prize handed out to talented princes of these royal lines.

 margrave_council_desc: "The power of the Margrave is greatly threatened by the ever-increasing power of our Estates. The Estates are of great benefit to our nation, but the very real threat they represent to our base of power necessitates the creation of a new council, one which reduces the very real power that the estates hold over our nation into more of an advisory position for the Margrave. This way, we may continue to exploit the benefits of our Estates while needing to worry little about their needs."

 gnv_home_of_calvin: "The Home of John Calvin"
 gnv_home_of_calvin_desc: "As John Calvin was spreading his beliefs throughout Europe, he found a safe haven in Geneva where he established a permanent home. From here, the beliefs of Calvinism spread and inspired new religions all across Europe; from as far as the Netherlands and Scotland. Who better exemplifies the values of the Reformed Church than Geneva?"

 gnv_unconquerable_city: "Unconquerable City"
 gnv_unconquerable_city_desc: "The history of Geneva is characterized in part by the endless efforts of the dukes of Savoy to subdue our city. We hold our independence strong against the would-be tyrants of Savoy, and the Grand Council will continue to refuse and resist the efforts of Savoy to subjugate our city under feudal rule. While we have often lived under the influence of a foreign power, we will only join another nation if it is by our own choice and on our own terms."
 gnv_armed_neutrality: "Armed Neutrality"
 gnv_armed_neutrality_desc: "If we are to continue to enjoy our freedom and neutrality, we will require an army who believe absolutely in the ideals of Geneva and are willing to die to protect our nation.

Several successive dukes in our line would be coronated by His Holiness, and it is our close relations with the voice of God here on Earth that makes the royal line of Ferrara truly the chosen people of God."
 FER_culture: "Center of Culture"
 FER_culture_desc: "Many composers and artists come to Ferrara from all around the world; Flanders, France, Holland, and from the countless states in the Empire. The works of these great artists have left an immense impact on Ferrara and have turned our city into a great center of arts and culture that all of Italy shall come to envy."

 FER_ferraran_arsenal_desc: "In Venice exists an arsenal designed purely to produce warships on mass. This is a crude and uncivilized method of warfare, and we in Ferrara understand that it is not the quantity of ships that shall win us the war; but the grandness of their designs. The Ferraran Arsenal must exist to make grand constructions, individual boats strong enough to topple entire navies of lesser nations!"

 URB_italian_wars_desc: "Italy is a subcontinent which finds itself in near constant strife and conflict. The various duchies, princes, and republics are always vying for dominance on the Italian peninsula, while Urbino remains safely within the bosom of the Papal States. Our position of safety and security leaves much room for profit as our famous condottiere armies venture across Italy seeking the most lucrative of mercenary contracts to bring the spoils of war back to Urbino."
 URB_condot_kings: "Condottiere Kings"
 URB_condot_kings_desc: "Many nations across the Italian peninsula generate their income through renting condottiere, but in Urbino such a thing is a way of life for our monarchs. Many of our Dukes gain a reputation for not only being excellent rulers but also becoming legends as Condottiere generals."
 URB_ducal_palace: "The Ducal Palace of Urbino"
 URB_ducal_palace_desc: "The city of Urbino bathes in the shadow of the great Ducal Palace of Urbino. The palace is a symbol of our ideology; our ideal court system, piety, and humanist traditions. Among the many features of this palace are two great chapels, one dedicated to God and Christ, and the other dedicated to the Muses of Hellenistic Paganism; a site where those who embrace our humanist teachings may give their respects to our glorious past."
 URB_humanist_court: "A Humanist Court"
 URB_humanist_court_desc: "Duke Federico da Montefeltro, though he swore fealty to the Papal States, he sought to embrace humanist ideals and assembled a sizeable court of humanists in the Ducal Palace of Urbino. His court consisted of only those who were willing to embrace Renaissance Humanism, learning from the great philosophers of the classical era, and setting aside zealousness in favor of rationalism."

 BLG_bentivoglio: "Bentivoglio Family"
 BLG_bentivoglio_desc: "Though we are explicitly a republic, there has always been one family dominating the Bolognese Republic - the Bentivoglio family. Its members have controlled the republic for almost a century and have the support of the people. The prestige and respect demanded by the Bentivoglio family raises them almost to the status of a royal family, but we should never abandon our republican roots."

 BLG_papal_rebellion_desc: "The Bentivoglio family fought fearlessly against the tyranny of the Papal States to secure the independence of Bologna. Though we were ultimately defeated, the scars of what the Papal States did to our nation remain deep and we shall never forget what the Catholic church did to us and we shall never pledge ourselves to any Vatican official."
 BLG_la_grassa: "La Grassa"
 BLG_la_grassa_desc: "The city of Bologna has earned many nicknames for its architecture and culture. La Grassa (the fat) refers to the famously rich cuisine of the city. While most Italian cities are known for the arts of painting and writing, the artists of Bologna instead express themselves through meat, cheese, tomatoes, and butter. Many dishes have become synonymous with the city and given Bologna a unique food culture unlike anywhere else on the Italian peninsula."
 BLG_la_rossa: "La Rossa"
 BLG_la_rossa_desc: "La Rossa is the nickname awarded to Bologna for the redness of our buildings. Our castles, mansions, and churches are all an iconic rose-red that has come to impress any who come to visit the city. The redness has become something of a symbol of patriotism in Bologna, and as such our city planners will not approve of any new construction unless it is in the passionate flaming red color of the rest of the city."

 MAN_studiolo: "The Countess's Studiolo"
 MAN_studiolo_desc: "Though a cabinet would usually be reserved only for men, the Countess of Mantua established her own studiolo which became famous in Mantua. It was her place of learning and meditation centered around the humanist school of thought, and perhaps many other bright young women in Mantua will follow the countess's example and adopt the practices of art and learning."
 MAN_noble_clergy: "Noble Clergymen"
 MAN_noble_clergy_desc: "The Gonzaga family has held tight ties with the clergy throughout its history and will continue to do so for as long as Mantua exists. In our history, there have been many members of our family who have been appointed as cardinals and bishops, to the point where our royal family exists almost entirely within the clerical class. These close ties with the clergy reduce their influence as an independent entity, and ensures their continued loyalty."
 MAN_walls: "Gonzaga's Walls"
 MAN_walls_desc: "In the 14th century, the great walls of Mantua were constructed by the Gonzaga family to protect Mantua from the hostile forces of Milan and Venice. The walls will serve to make our nation impenetrable, and our armies defending the gates will keep our nation happy and safe."

 MAN_soldiers_desc: "We are small in size and subject to the influence of foreign powers; however the strength and discipline of our troops has made us more useful as an ally than a target for war. To maintain our independence, we have continually deployed our troops for use in foreign wars in exchange for protection, and this has shaped the men of Mantua into fierce warriors."

 MAN_mercenary_princes_desc: "It is common practice in Mantua to have the heir to the county serve as a military leader and gain expertise in the art of war before rising to lead as Count.

 PGA_herculanus_desc: "Herculanus of Perugia was a Christian bishop loyal to Perugia who valiantly defended the city from the savage Ostrogothic invaders in the 6th century. He attempted to fool the invaders by feeding the last sack of grain to a weak lamb, to fool the invaders into believing that the city had vast stores of food and could withstand a siege. The Ostrogoths were successful in their invasion of Perugia regardless, and the soldiers had the wise Herculanus's head removed from his body. Miraculously though, four days after his head had started to rot and decay, it was reunited with his body and Herculanus spent the rest of his days Christianizing the Ostrogothic Kingdom. This tale of perseverance and cunning symbolizes the endurance of our people, and will serve as an example of how to resist invaders for generations."
 PGA_umbrian_hegemony: "Umbrian Hegemony"
 PGA_umbrian_hegemony_desc: "Though the majority of Umbria is held by the Papal States, Perugia finds itself at the very heart of Umbrian politics and is a symbol of the Umbrian identity. Though many Catholics in the region would flock to the Papal States, those of a more secular leaning feel a greater kinship with our great nation."

 PGA_signoria: "Perugian Signoria"
 PGA_signoria_desc: "In its early history, Perugia found itself in constant political strife. The conflicts between the nobility and the peasantry almost tore our nation apart, and after the death of Lord Biordo Michelotti, the city became a mere subject to foreign powers. But with the blessing of the Pope, the condottiere general Braccio da Montone established control over Perugia as a republic, and our nation has remained as strong and stable as one can expect from an Italian republic in the 15th century."
 PGA_heartbeat_of_christianity: "Heartbeat of Christianity"
 PGA_heartbeat_of_christianity_desc: "Though explicitly a secular power in nature, the relationship between Perugia and the Catholic church has always been intimate. As well as being host to many Papal Conclaves, there were even a few Popes who seemed to prefer the surroundings of Perugia to Rome itself and many Vatican representatives have fought to ensure the continued independence of our nation. Truly, no nation represents the values of Western Christianity quite like Perugia!"
 PGA_war_of_eight_saints: "The War of the Eight Saints"
 PGA_war_of_eight_saints_desc: "As tensions grew between the expansionist Papal States and many of the secular powers across Europe, Perugia found itself caught in a war between the Florentine Republic and the Catholic church. The Florentines inspired us to fight against the tyranny of the Vatican and assert our democratic values as a free and independent city-state. Although these efforts ultimately failed, the conviction of our belief in democracy will continue to inspire our soldiers to fight not for God or men; but for the Republic!"

This is a family with a dream of Italian hegemony. The Baglioni family dream of a state governed from Perugia that stretches all the way from Bologna to Naples and perhaps even further. Now that we have established our ideology and our beliefs, we may begin to turn this dream into a reality and expand our state all across Italy and beyond!"

It is the solemn duty of all Christians to protect those of the true faith, and to convert those who have been misled by demons and false prophets."
 SZO_mint: "The Marquis Mint"
 SZO_mint_desc: "The Castle of Saluzzo was designed to keep the Marquis safe and comfortable during times of siege, but as Saluzzo has continued to grow into an economic center in alpine Italy, it has become just as necessary to protect our gold and goods as to protect the Marquis himself. The construction of a Marquis Mint should keep our riches safe from foreign hands, and aid with the protection of the coin we worked so hard to squeeze out of the mountain mineral deposits and our loyal taxpayers."

Through a great deal of luck and political maneuvering, the small margrave of Montferrat has found itself in dynastic union with the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of France, and the Duchy of Savoy amongst other major powers.

 MFA_byzantine_claimants_desc: "There were several marriages between the Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire and the Aleramicis of Montferrat, including that of the marriage of Irene of Montferrat and Andronikos II Palaiologos. Irene's marriage is what brought the Italian branch of the Byzantine royal family to Montferrat and created some sense of unity between the Holy Roman Empire and East Rome. As the Ottoman Turks have ravaged their way through Palaiologos controlled Greece and brought the Byzantine Empire to its knees, it's the responsibility of Montferrat to restore order and continue to assert the dignity and prestige of our ancient bloodline!"

By remaining neutral in matters of religion, we may perhaps continue to be amiable to the Papal loyalists and those seeking reform."
 LUC_libertas: "Libertas!"
 LUC_libertas_desc: "Lucca traded hands a great many times before becoming a free and independent democracy. First, we were occupied by the Bavarians who sold our great city off to the Genoese, then swiftly occupied by the King of Bohemia who felt it right to sell it off to the Rossi of Parma, and this chain of occupation and sale went on for quite some time. Ultimately, the Emperor himself interfered and deemed that Lucca was a prize so precious that it deserved to become a free and independent city. Even today, our merchants carry a blue flag labelled “Libertas” as a reminder of the great gift of independence bestowed upon us by the Holy Roman Emperor."

Our fishermen venture out onto the lake each day, and find themselves in dispute with the fishermen of Florence over who exactly has the right to be there. A compromise was found in draining the lake and dividing ownership across its border. This ingenious feat of environmental manipulation expanded our inhabitable land without the need for war or conflict. Perhaps by continuing to shape our environment, we can bring further development to Lucca, what could go wrong?"

The title was created due to a growing number of commoners in the city finding themselves ascending to the burgher class, and was used to give the craftsmen and artisans of our nation a voice in the republic.

We struggled to keep our independence as the Venetians interfered in our politics and ultimately executed our good Lord Francesco, seizing control of the city.

Under Venice, we maintained our royal titles. The independent principalities were governed by our own people, but the Kingdom of Dalmatia existed under union with the Republic of Venice. Whether under a King of our own, or a foreigner, the stability granted by our dual-government system shall keep the people pacified and productive."

By expanding the rulership of the Principalities to all of Dalmatia's overseas holdings, we shall be secure in the knowledge that our subjects will dutifully pass their goods and wealth back home to the heart of Dalmatia."

As such, Dalmatia is a rare melting pot of cultures gathering amidst our vast swaths of Principalities. By melding these many languages and cultures together into a single identity, we shall create a new culture that is distinct from all others, yet familiar to Slavs, Greeks, and Latins alike."

Now that our government is also free from Venetian hands, we may centralize the scattered armies of the Principalities into a United Dalmatian Force!"
 DAL_arsenal: "The Independent Arsenal"

Under the wise rulership of King Marianus IV of Sardinia and Corsica, and with support from the Crown of Aragon, the entirety of Sardinia was recovered and returned to its rightful self-rule under King Marianus. Although we later integrated with the Aragonese, we shall never forget the bravery demonstrated by our good king who built his kingdom on the ashes of Genoa."

Any time the Kingdom has found itself divided amongst Republican and feudal rule, the Papacy has always insisted that the only true ruler of any city on the island is the King of Sardinia, whoever he happens to be. Though our future remains uncertain, one thing we can always rely on is the support of the Papacy."
 SAR_viceroyalty: "The Sardinian Viceroyalty"
 SAR_viceroyalty_desc: "Though we spent many years holding the Aragonese Crown like Atlas holds the Globe, we did not do so without struggle. The Judicates were always resistant to a foreign ruler, and the only way Aragon could maintain its flimsy grasp on the island was to establish a Sardinian Viceroy to govern the Kingdom in his name. The necessity of the Viceroyalty is evidence of the Sardinian spirit, and by keeping a man of our culture eternally on the throne, we shall ensure the loyalty of our people."

Sardinia is home to a unique blend of Romanesque architecture and magnificent new innovative styles that other nations cannot even attempt to replicate, and all this finery is created for the glory of God."

However, now that we are free, the Moor has come to symbolize Corsica itself, and the blindfold symbolizes the tyranny of foreign subjugation. While the Moor remains unblindfolded, Corsica remains free, and he shall serve as an icon to liberate our people, should we ever fall subject to a foreign power."

 COR_battle_of_meloria_desc: "This historic battle took place off the coast of Corsica and would determine the future of the island. The crushing defeat of the Pisans not only marked the end of Pisan rule over Corsica, but also the end of the Pisan republic itself as its holdings were picked apart by the Florentine Republic and Genoa. We shall never forget the impact that a strong navy can have on a nation, and control of the Corsican sea determines control of Corsica itself."
 COR_league: "The Corsican League"
 COR_league_desc: "For years, Corsica was governed by a league of city-states and bishoprics and this style of government ensured that the people of Corsica enjoyed both the freedoms granted by a republic, and were able to serve God in the exact and appropriate manner. Similar to the Swiss league across the sea, the autonomy granted to the Corsican cities makes their treasuries overflow with gold and their armies overflowing with men ready to die for the Corsican cause."
 COR_iron_bank: "The Bank of Saint George"
 COR_iron_bank_desc: "When the Genoese were struggling to maintain their illegitimate hold over the island, control was handed over to the Bank of Saint George; a religious and financial institution designed to consolidate the debts of all people living in the republic of Genoa. Although we have now escaped Genoese control, the bank still remains a powerful entity within our government and is a useful tool for rooting out the many corrupt and indebted souls throughout our nation."

Wilhelm asserted that as her husband, he should have as much right to the possessions of the county as the countess, and he spent lavishly from the treasury and wasted the tax money of the county on needless frivolities.

 MBZ_resisting_habsburgs: "Resisting Habsburg Hegemony"
 MBZ_resisting_habsburgs_desc: "We are the last bastion of Austrian sovereignty outside of Habsburg control. In our nation is the last hope for Austria to stand against the Habsburgs and our mere continued existence is a threat to their control over the Austrian people, and the Empire. Perhaps if we were to demonstrate that we do not fear their monstrous line, we could threaten the legitimacy of Habsburg rule."
 MBZ_sale_of_titles: "The Sale of Bregenz Titles"
 MBZ_sale_of_titles_desc: "Due to the massive expenditure of our foolish Count, the Countess found herself in deep financial difficulties. Reluctantly, her properties had to be sold off to the Habsburgs to ensure the continued survival of the Bregenz line."
 MBZ_shadow_of_pfander: "In the Shadow of Pfander"
 MBZ_shadow_of_pfander_desc: "Our nation is surrounded, with a lake on one side of the city, and the great mount Pfander on the other. Therefor, the city can only be entered from a few key areas and if we were to defend and fortify our borders, the shared bounty of the mountain and the lake would keep us safe from hostile invaders."
 MBZ_lake_constance_navy: "The Lake Constance Navy"
 MBZ_lake_constance_navy_desc: "Right from the very early days of our nation, Bregenz has felt the call of the open waters. When the Romans colonized the area, the city that would become Bregenz was made into the naval capital of Lake Constance, and designated the Admiralty of the area. Perhaps if we one day reach the open seas, we may show the world just how powerful the Constance navy truly is."

 GOS_mining_traditions: "Goslar Mining Traditions"
 GOS_mining_traditions_desc: "Since the days of the Roman Empire, Goslar has been a mining town, and the rich iron deposits of our home will continue to provide our wealth for centuries more to come. As a long lineage of iron mining characterizes countless families in Goslar, and fathers train their sons to follow in their footsteps, we can see no end to the mining culture that has characterized our nation."
 GOS_kaiserpfalz: "Kaiserpfalz"
 GOS_kaiserpfalz_desc: "Though many Emperors now call Wien their home, there was a time when Goslar itself was the seat of the Emperor. Goslar was home to the very first imperial synod, where bishops and the Emperor decided the laws of religion that govern our lives. Even today the old Kaiserpfalz stands in the heart of our town; laying empty, waiting for the day when the Emperor once again calls Goslar his home. One day, perhaps our little Free City could once again be the seat of the Empire."
 GOS_city_rights: "Goslar City Rights"
 GOS_city_rights_desc: "When the Emperor withdrew his control over the City, we became more dependent on trade and merchants to bring their riches to Northern Germany. As such, the bill of rights that governs our daily lives greatly favors the rights of merchants living in or passing through our town, and as such many of the Burgher class choose to make Goslar their home and bring their riches to our small town."
 GOS_hanseatic_league: "Capitalizing on the Hanseatic League"
 GOS_hanseatic_league_desc: "While most nations joined the Hanseatic League to secure their independence and take advantage of the trading benefits of the union, we used the security and rights given by the League to advance our interests in the trade of foreign nations and as a political tool to pass legislation and further refine the governmental systems of our great city."
 GOS_hunting_robber_barons: "Hunting Down the Robber Barons"
 GOS_hunting_robber_barons_desc: "These days it seems that unscrupulous robber barons are a common sight on the country roads of Germany, stealing the goods and gear of our productive merchant class. It's become clear that we must perform a massive expansion of our military if we are to counter these highwaymen and restore order to the roads of Germany!"
 GOS_resisting_welfs: "Resisting the Welfs"
 GOS_resisting_welfs_desc: "Following the end of the Emperor's rule of Goslar, we were made a Free City, and our independence was assured by the Emperor himself. However, the concept of a city not governed by a monarch or royal family seems to be a foreign concept to uncivilized families like the Welfs as the continually make efforts to subjugate our city and take control of our precious iron mines. We have never fallen to this so-called "
 GOS_the_leagues: "Joining the Leagues"
 GOS_the_leagues_desc: "The continued efforts of the Welfs to subjugate us have gone ignored by the Emperor. Although our Free City status allegedly assures our independence, it has become clear that the Emperor is far too idle to sufficiently protect us, so we must protect ourselves! By entering trade and military leagues with our neighbors, we may finally have some respite from war and conflict."

 ROT_zarfat_registry: "Zarfat Registry"
 ROT_zarfat_registry_desc: "Most towns only keep a church registry on Christians born in their borders, but here in Rothenburg, we grant refuge to Jewish merchants and holy men. Meir von Rothenburg was a holy man born from a long line of Rabbis who became known as Maharam, meaning Our Teacher. He was well known for the many great works of writing he created in our town, and was living proof of the virtues of showing charity and tolerance for those who worship God in their own peculiar way."
 ROT_beautiful_city: "The Beautiful City"
 ROT_beautiful_city_desc: "Our city has known much destruction and devastation over the years, and the old symbols of the monarchy have steadily crumbled to be replaced with symbols of our faith and our republican traditions. As such, castles have crumbled and been replaced with monasteries, and the homes in the heart of the city have been built by rich merchants more concerned with aesthetics than practicality. So beautiful is our city that many propose we simply stop building and enjoy the magnificence of Rothenburg as it is."
 ROT_end_of_the_line: "The End of the Line"
 ROT_end_of_the_line_desc: "Many other Free Cities in the Empire were made so due to some quirk in their governments leading to the Emperor seizing and abandoning control, but Rothenburg's line died out naturally, and for a few dark years, our city knew no ruler. We have never been directly held by the Emperor, and have always been a free and independent city in some way or another. It was Emperor Rudolf von Habsburg granted us our Free City status, and thus our free republican government has become inseparable from Rothenburg culture."
 ROT_hinterland_knights: "The Knights of the Hinterland"
 ROT_hinterland_knights_desc: "Knights of the German Order patrol the hinterlands around our city, keeping us safe from bandits and barbarians. In order to continue their holy duty, we must cooperate with these knights and have our citizens build them a great monastery. Only then can we attract these good men to our city and keep ourselves safe from invaders and bandits."
 ROT_drink_of_war: "The Drink of War"
 ROT_drink_of_war_desc: "There is a popular legend amongst the people of Rothenburg. The legend states that the Count of Tilly had besieged our town and intended to burn it to the ground, but the city council attempted to sway him to mercy with a drink of three liters of wine. He scoffed, and demanded that if the mayor could finish the drink alone, he would spare the city. Our magnificent mayor had an iron gut and a will of steel and he finished the drink without even pausing for breath, and true to his word, the Count declared that the city was saved. So, it is true, no man can handle his drink like a man of Rothenburg!"
 ROT_holy_blood: "The Holy Blood"
 ROT_holy_blood_desc: "Our cooperation with the German Order has made our city into a holy place, popular with pilgrims from all across Europe. One popular pilgrim's route is the Holy Blood Pilgrimage, which has Rothenburg as one of its major cities along the route. Pilgrims often bring riches and goods with them, which we could of course take advantage of…"
 ROT_klingentorturm: "Klingentorturm"
 ROT_klingentorturm_desc: "Our city is surrounded by walls, and these walls have kept us safe from both the bandits and raiders of the German countryside and foreign invading armies. Many men of our nation see it as their patriotic duty to man the walls at least once in their life. While Klingentorturm stands, Rothenburg shall stand."

 ANH_mittelgebirge: "Mittelgebirge"
 ANH_mittelgebirge_desc: "Our home is situated between the mountains of the Harz and the River Elbe, protected and cut off from the rest of Saxony. This relative isolation and defensive position has brought prosperity to Anhalt for centuries, and if we continue to remain out of the petty conflicts of our fellow Princes, we shall make Anhalt into the pearl of the Elbe."
 ANH_branches: "The Branches of Anhalt"
 ANH_branches_desc: "When the good Duke Henry passed, his territories were divided amongst his three sons, who in turn would also partition their territories amongst their sons, and so the royal administration of Anhalt would continue to divide and grow with each generation. Though many branches converge and consolidate into one, this style of government shall facilitate for the expansion of Anhalt and the growth and prosperity of our royal line."
 ANH_incorporating_the_bishopric: "Incorporation of the Bishopric"
 ANH_incorporating_the_bishopric_desc: "Long ago, our nation was divided between the Princedom of Anhalt and the Bishopric of Halberstadt on the north side of the Harz mountains. When Duke Henry passed, his territories were divided amongst his sons, and with a promise to always follow the one true word of God, the Bishop of Halberstadt pledged fealty to Henry's eldest son and joined the Aschersleben district."
 ANH_castle: "Anhalt Castle"
 ANH_castle_desc: "Although our nation has long been protected by the mountains and rivers of our home, the terrain alone was not sufficient to protect us from invaders. In spite of our small size, Anhalt Keep was quickly transformed into Anhalt Castle, built in the Harz Mountains to protect our nation from any entering with malicious intent. It's the necessity of survival that motivates the swiftness of our builders, and if Anhalt is to continue to protect itself from subjugation, we must continue this tradition of cheap and rapid construction."
 ANH_garden_kingdom: "Dessau Garden Kingdom"
 ANH_garden_kingdom_desc: "Our home is full of vast empty spaces, but our Royal line deserves something to demonstrate the wealth and power held within Anhalt. Though many would construct a palace or a cathedral, our wise nobility desire instead to establish a garden so vast and beautiful that it is itself a Kingdom for noblemen to explore."
 ANH_schultheiss: "The Duke and the Schultheiss"
 ANH_schultheiss_desc: "One of the largest settlements in the Duchy of Anhalt is Dessau, which itself is governed autonomously by an individual selected by the Duke and elected by the people. Rulership in this style is common across Anhalt and guarantees that tax collection in our many towns and villages is carried out in an exact and expedient manner without embezzlement."
 ANH_confessor: "The Confessor"
 ANH_confessor_desc: "With the Reformation spreading through the Christian world, it is time Anhalt took a stance on this worrisome matter. By siding with the reformers and adopting the title of the Confessor, we may end the corruption of Catholicism in our nation, and spread the one true word of God, free from the finery and fakery of the Catholics!"

 AUS_outback_stations: "Outback Stations"
 AUS_outback_stations_desc: "The Outback is a harsh and unforgiving wilderness devoid of necessary amenities for life such as rivers and rainfall. However, we have adopted a method of farming akin to American ranching, where the landowner is granted Crown lands on which to raise his cattle and horses. This method of ranching is adaptable to all conditions, and has made regions of the country that would usually be useless into productive vital components of the state."
 AUS_land_down_under: "The Land Down Under"
 AUS_land_down_under_desc: "Oceania was the last continent to be discovered by the Europeans, and Australia is by far the largest singular landmass on the Oceanic continent. The creatures found in Australia were at one point considered so fantastical and otherworldly that many Europeans simply did not believe they could exist until they saw them with their own eyes. The unfamiliar nature of our wildlife and geography makes Australia deadly for invading armies. We were once foreigners to this land as well, but we have adapted to the harsh conditions of the outback and our soldiers can easily adapt to any foreign soil."
 AUS_eureka_rebellion: "The Eureka Rebellion"
 AUS_eureka_rebellion_desc: "We were sent over to Australia by our former overlord as prisoners, unwanted minorities, and political insurgents from the homeland to work the gold mines in this alien land. Our overlord was foolish enough to believe that sending men who had reason to hate the state would not instigate a rebellion, but the gold miners did inevitably raise their flag in rebellion against the crown. Our overlord demanded that we surrender most of the riches accumulated from mining our gold, but we were having none of that nonsense! It was this rebellion that birthed the Eureka Flag, and although this rebellion failed, we now finally stand as an independent nation, and nobody will take Australian gold but Australians!"

Now that we are free from colonial rule, we are free to unite the six provinces into one and we will make Australia into a fierce uncontested force in the Pacific."
 AUS_bushrangers: "Integration of the Bushrangers"
 AUS_bushrangers_desc: "A sizeable number of settlers sent from the mainland to live in Australia were convicts and undesirables forced into exile, and the particularly cunning amongst these thieves and cutthroats would become Bushrangers. These were hardened men who used the unforgiving Australian bush as a base for their robbing operations. They were particularly rich and powerful during the Australian Gold Rush, but now that we have won our freedom for our colonial oppressors, these men are convicts to no-one, and we would do well to utilise their ambushing tactics on our enemies!"

 swabian_river_iller: "By the River Iller"
 swabian_river_iller_desc: "We are separated from the Bavarians by the River Iller, and with the expansion of the Bavarian dukes to our East, the river will prove useful not only in feeding our crops and keeping Swabia fertile, but also as a defensive position in any conflict we find ourselves in against the Bavarians."
 swabian_bavarian_resistance: "Bavarian Resistance"
 swabian_bavarian_resistance_desc: "Much like any region in the Empire, the Swabian states find themselves in as much conflict with each-other as any external threat. With our neighbors to the East consolidating into a centralized Kingdom and with growing Habsburg influence in the region, we must set our petty squabbles aside and work to maintain the independence of all Swabian states."
 swabian_decapole: "Decapole"
 swabian_decapole_desc: "The Decapole was an alliance formed by the Imperial states on the French border, of which many are Swabian. Though we usually depend on the Empire to support our independence, the internal politics of the Empire is always in turmoil, and it is only by forming alliances like the Decapole that we may truly resist foreign influence."
 swabian_reclaiming_the_duchy: "Reclaiming the Duchy"
 swabian_reclaiming_the_duchy_desc: "The Duchy of Swabia was dissolved over a century ago, but the dream of reuniting the nation is strong amongst all of the successor states. Our attempts to reconsolidate thus far have been quashed by the Emperor, but he cannot keep us suppressed forever!"
 swabian_thorn_of_the_empire: "The Thorn of the Empire"
 swabian_thorn_of_the_empire_desc: "Throughout our history, the Emperor has sought to do little else but bring us to heel, but Swabia is no Habsburg lapdog. We will continue to be a thorn in the Emperor's side, until we have removed all traces of Habsburg influence from Swabia!"
 swabian_habsburg_league: "The Habsburg League"
 swabian_habsburg_league_desc: "Inspired by the Swiss leagues to our south, the Emperor organized the many Swabian city-states into a free and independent league with a Habsburg Prince as its leader. Unlike the Swiss Cantons which organize their government around mutual protection and a shared desire for independence and freedom, the Swabian League is a much more aggressive and militaristic union designed to contest the Swiss. Though many Swabians support the idea of joining the Swiss League, we must maintain the illusion that the Swabian League will do just as well to keep our independence."

 LAU_partition_of_saxony: "The Partition of Saxony"
 LAU_partition_of_saxony_desc: "Our nation was born out of the partitioning of the original Duchy of Saxony. When John I abdicated his duties as Duke, he determined he would divide his titles and government amongst his sons and brothers. This deconstruction of the old Saxon state makes it somewhat unclear who is the rightful owner of what, but the confusion certainly does make claiming the region a much easier task."
 LAU_diarchy: "Diarchic Duchy"
 LAU_diarchy_desc: "Once the Duchy of Saxony had been dissolved and our nation fully established, we spent an extensive few years under a diarchic government of Eric I and a few of his brothers. Dissolving this government and centralizing Saxe-Lauenburg into a free duchy in its own right was a great challenge, but the political maneuverings taken by Eric I have made our dukes masters of statecraft and pleasing the court."
 LAU_niedersachsen: "Niedersachsen"
 LAU_niedersachsen_desc: "We find ourselves in constant conflict with the Saxon successor states, many of which hold more lands and titles than our Duke. The other nations in the area see us as pretenders to the Saxon throne, and while it may be a nice idea to sit the throne of Saxony, we need a new title for our nation that at least gives the illusion that we have no desire to unite the Saxon nations. Niedersachsen, meaning Lower Saxony, both confirms that we do not claim to be the successors to the old Saxon duchy while not weakening our claim to the title, should we choose to pursue it."
 LAU_claiming_electorate: "Claiming the Electorate"
 LAU_claiming_electorate_desc: "While we may never reunite Saxony into a single nation, we would certainly like to hold the electoral position in the Empire that our nation once held. Currently, the Saxon states are divided into the Upper-Saxon Circle and the Lower-Saxon Circle, and it is the Upper Saxons that have the Emperor's favor and hold the electoral position. Perhaps by making the Emperor more amiable to our cause, we may make the Lower-Saxon Circle the Emperor's choice for any future electoral positions."
 LAU_church_of_hadeln: "The Church Order of Hadeln"
 LAU_church_of_hadeln_desc: "With the reformation burning its way through Europe, Saxe-Lauenburg must decide whether it will remain loyal to the Vatican or branch out and form its own church based on the teachings of Luther. The People of Hadeln have already begun organizing an ecclesiastical order centered on the Reformation, and with our Duke's approval and embracement of Protestant teachings, the order could be officially recognized and form a vital part of our government."
 LAU_centralisation: "Lauenburg Centralization"
 LAU_centralisation_desc: "Even as our state expands and grows, and our ruler claims more and more titles, Lauenburg remains the seat of power in the Duchy. The walls of Lauenburg Castle are impenetrable, and our central position in the Schleswig-Holstein area makes our great capital an ideal location for governing northern Germany."
 LAU_salty_salty_salty: "Old Salt Route"
 LAU_salty_salty_salty_desc: "The Old Salt Route is a trade route through Northern Germany, and Saxe-Lauenburg is an important trade capital in this salty business. So profitable is this trade route that salt is often referred to as “white gold”, and although this “gold” can be easily acquired by boiling the briny waters of Lünburg, the profits it brings to Saxe-Lauenburg through this lucrative trade speak for themselves."

Though those days are long behind us, the prestige of our bloodline and our claim to the divine right to rule the Rhine is not a matter of dispute."
 BRG_julich_berg: "Duchy of Julich-Berg"
 BRG_julich_berg_desc: "Following the downfall, of the Lotharingian Kingdom, our territory was divided into two regions; the county of Mark and the county of Berg. The count would later be elevated to Duke rank by Emperor Wenceslaus, granting us some of our lost territories and titles back in the process."
 BRG_united_duchies: "The United Duchies"
 BRG_united_duchies_desc: "As our mighty duchy expands, the varying succession laws and increasing number of claimants to our titles is beginning to grow a little confusing. We find ourselves constantly falling in and out of unions, and forming unions of our own. Modelling our state as a series of separate and autonomous duchies united under a single duke may prove useful in maintaining all of our various lands and titles."

 BRG_seat_of_the_electorate_desc: "As our united duchies grow closer to the Electorate of the Palatinate, the chances of our two nations coming into union are beginning to appear more likely. However, should such a thing ever occur, it is clear that Dusseldorf would become the new capital of the Palatine Electorate."
 BRG_rhineland_market: "The Rhineland Market"
 BRG_rhineland_market_desc: "As our influence in the Rhineland grows, Dusseldorf is beginning to grow into quite the metropolis. Merchants are flocking to the market square on the bank of the Rhine, and the prosperity from the market is beginning to spread throughout the entire city. Cathedrals, mansions, and stately homes are becoming a common sight in Dusseldorf, and we would be foolish not to capitalize on this prosperity and make our great city into one of the most prestigious in all of Germany!"

In the city-castle, our noble class have constructed an art gallery swimming with the most breathtaking sculptures and paintings in all of Germany, and nobility from all across the Empire are flocking to see the incredible collection housed in Dusseldorf."
 BRG_happy_clergy: "Respecting the Autonomy of the Clergy"
 BRG_happy_clergy_desc: "Even as our state expands across the Rhine, we have never done any harm to the good men of the cloth that occupy the Rhineland.

 HRZ_saint_sava: "Saint Sava"
 HRZ_saint_sava_desc: "The official title of our nation is the Duchy of Saint Sava. We adopted this title to distance ourselves from the newly converted Catholic Kingdom of Bosnia, and to venerate the great Saint Sava who had been a unifying icon for many of the different peoples of the Balkans. Saint Sava was a count of Hum who abandoned his royal titles to become a monk on Mount Athos, which he would then transform into an important religious center for the Orthodox church with the establishment of the Monastary of Hilandar. Saint Sava represents to us our dedication to the Orthodox church and is the icon that separates us from the Bosnian Kingdom."

 HRZ_stjepan_rebellion_desc: "When the King of Bosnia dared to stray from the one true faith, our good leader Stjepan used Herzegovina as the grounds to mount his rebellion. Whether we continue to practice Eastern Orthodoxy or not, the spirit of what makes us Herzegovinian is entrenched in resistance and strength and we shall never serve any “King” who dares to demand us to change."

 HRZ_ottoman_accommodation_desc: "While many other nations resist the growing power of the Ottoman Turks, many nobles in Herzegovina flock to the Turks for support in overthrowing the tyrannical regime in Bosnia. Perhaps by embracing the rise of the Ottomans, we may be able to manipulate their nobility and armies into fighting for our cause and advancing our interests in the Balkans."

 HRZ_herceg_desc: "When we declared our independence from the Kingdom of Bosnia, we were neither a King nor a Duke. Our wise leader Stjepan adopted the title “Herceg”, a title borrowed from the Holy Roman Empire. So, the secular title for the Duchy of Saint Sava came to be Herzegovina, the lands belonging to the Herceg. With our national identity tied to our brilliant leader, we shall remain united in our absolute devotion to the wise rulers of our nation as they guide us down the path to victory and prosperity."

However, it seems that the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] savages refuse to accept our superior ways, and our harsh treatment of these native people has only served to increase tensions between the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribesmen and our colonists. The only question now is how do we resolve this situation?"
 EVTDESC3074.TC: "It would seem that our harsh treatment of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people living in [Root.GetName] has paid off in a massive way. Forcing those primitives off of their rich fertile soil has created new opportunities for our  settlers to take their place and our colonial companies have already begun exploiting the ancestral land of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName], but they request financial aid to complete the construction of the new settlement."

The muxe are a group of people who were determined as being male at birth, but have since come to acknowledge themselves as female. They wear traditional women’s clothing, identify with female titles, and usually abandon their birth name in favor of something more conventionally feminine.\n\nUsually, the muxe are of little concern to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has confessed that she is a member of the muxe community and has entered court introducing herself as [Root.muxe_advisor_name.GetName]. As a woman, she is ineligible to continue serving beside the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but her unique talents make her a difficult asset to let go.\n\nSome high ranking officials at court are suggesting that the talents of [Root.muxe_advisor_name.GetName] are evidence that we are missing out on an endless trove of talent by forbidding women from serving at court and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would be well-advised to revise the legal requirements for becoming a royal advisor."

 ALA_secretary_icebox_desc: "Even though Alaskan lands were purchased at a ridiculously low price, costing a mere 2 cents per acre, the purchase of Alaska was ridiculed as being the “Secretary’s Icebox”, mocking the ministers who purchased our lands. What those short-sighted fools failed to recognise was the hidden value of Alaska and its resources, and even now, we are underestimated by our rivals."

From there, more trading posts, forts, and eventually villages popped up along the shores of Cascadia until the region was rife with towns and colonies of equal size and grandeur to those in the East."

 hussite.6.d: "Though it was the moderate Utraquists that triumphed in the Hussite Wars, the resurgence of the Hussite faith throughout [Root.GetName] has led to the resurfacing of radical Taborite sects. They seek to abolish all forms of theological authority besides the Biblical scriptures and to reject Catholic influences to the greatest possible degree.

As the Hussite armies were composed largely of peasant infantry and had little cavalry of their own to bring to the field, war wagons provided a solid defence against cavalry charges from better equipped enemies. Many of our commanders are Orphans, veterans of the Hussite Wars, and wish to make this tactic into official military doctrine."

 rajput_musketeerDESCR: "As the development of firearms progressed the equipment of Indian musketmen increased in quality. Precision and long range was given priority as the Mughals would continue to use musketeers as sharpshooters or marksmen. The Mughals would also continue the use of musketeers in the direct service of the central authority (as opposed to the cavalry arm in the hands of the Mansabdars)."
 reformed_mughal_mansabdarDESCR: "The Sikhs of the Punjab would develop a special kind of cavalry fighting style inspired by the Persian and Afghan armies. This was referred to as 'dhai-phat' or 'two-and-a-half' strikes. A group of cavalry would ride up to the enemy and fire their matchlocks, retreat and repeat. When the enemy was sufficiently softened the great mass of the cavalry charged with their sabers. Similarly many north Indian states increasingly came to incorporate mobile musket-armed cavalry troopers in their armies, often recruited from the many Afghan tribesmen in the region."
 indian_shock_cavalryDESCR: "The Western Deccan, an area of hills, jungles and many forts proved quite hard to subdue for the large and heavily equipped Mughal armies. In its desperate fight to survive the Ahmednagar sultanate pioneered the use of light cavalry to harass the Mughal forces. The Maratha horsemen employed by Ahmednagar were so successful that they were soon employed by other rulers as well."
 bhonsle_infantryDESCR: "Many tribesmen of the Kanara, Desh and Malnad regions, such as the Berads and Mavales, adopted matchlock muskets for hunting and warfare early on. Due to their familiarity with the weapons these tribesmen soon became the primary musketmen in southern India. The Maratha armies in particular came to rely on these tribal groups for recruiting infantry to their armies. The tribal organization of the troops was often kept, with the headmen serving as officers. Berads and Mavales would increasingly be deployed in Maratha, Mughal and Mysorean armies during the 17th and 18th centuries and would eventually form the core of future European-style infantry regiments in the area."
 indian_archersDESCR: "While Elephants were a common element in most Indian armies they would often only be used in smaller numbers by commanders and as a supplement to the cavalry or infantry. In the regions dominated by jungle however, such as Orissa or Bastar, horses are both hard to use effectively and to keep in good health. As a result armies in these regions would rely much more on larger units of elephants used as mobile archer platforms."
 indian_arquebusierDESCR: "With the general lack of interest in the development of infantry tactics in Indian armies the advent of fire arms would at first not make a big impact. While common in Indian armies they would not make up a sizable part of the infantry troops for a long time and firearms would continue to be used in an individual way rather than adopted for specific formations. Rather than equipping their own units with the new weapons the Indian states would initially be content to hire foreign, often Turkoman, arquebusiers as a supplement to their archers and artillery."
 rajput_hill_fightersDESCR: "With the arrival of Muslim powers came an increased influx of good foreign cavalry mounts to India. The use of Muslim military tactics eventually became commonplace even in the armies of Hindu states such as the Vijayanagara Empire. In the north-west the Rajput warriors quickly adapted to the tactics of the Indian sultanates and a new breed of Rajput cavalry horses also soon emerged. The care and breeding of these Marwari horses would take on a highly ceremonial and revered role in the highly militant Rajput societies. In the southern Indian climate breeding cavalry mounts proved harder and south Indian rulers found themselves having to rely on the traders of the Indian Ocean to supply their cavalry."
 mughal_mansabdarDESCR: "Throughout the 15th century cavalry continued to be the most influential of the combat arms in India. The arrival of Babur in the early 16th century and the birth of the Mughal Empire came to further accentuate this trend. Babur made use of large contingents of cavalry archers from the steppes of Transoxiana during his invasion and the Mughals who came after him would continue to rely on a large cavalry arm. As the other states in northern India tried to catch up with the Mughal military machine many of them came to rely increasingly on the use of Central Asian adventurers as cavalry officers. One of these Afghan adventurers would come to found the short-lived Suri Empire in eastern and central India."
 tipu_sultan_rocketDESCR: "As the 18th century progressed Indian infantry came to fight more coordinated, with a higher rate of fire and be put to much better use than before. The addition of military innovations such as Mysorean rockets and the integration of Indian light cavalry allowed Indian states to be much more successful against European armies. Striking a good balance at this, Mysore in particular would, under Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan, come to propel itself from a local kingdom to a regional South Indian power."
 indian_footsoldierDESCR: "In Indian military history the infantry was often cheap to come by and easy to replace due to the large Indian population. Cavalry on the other hand was expensive and had often, at least since the arrival of the Muslim armies in the 13th century, proved to be the decisive element on Indian battlefields. Perhaps because of this the development of infantry tactics would not receive as much attention during most of the early modern era. The role of the infantry was to make up the bulk of a force and to siege the many forts of the Indian subcontinent."
 indian_elephantDESCR: "As the Mughal empire grew the need for a central organization to keep track of its many power holders became a necessity. Under Akbar a numerical ranking system for all nobles (Mansabdars) was implemented. Jagirs, allowances and the number of cavalry troopers a noble was obliged to field, would become dependent on this rank."
 mughal_musketeerDESCR: "With Babur's invasion of India the subcontinent saw its first organized use of fire arms. Unlike in the west, however, the musketmen, or Toofangchis, as used by Babur would serve as marksmen in his armies, firing individually at specific targets both during pitched battles and sieges. Babur took care to train these troops to achieve better results and unlike the Mughal cavalry arm the recruitment, training and organization of musketmen would be kept under his direct control. Whether Babur's great success at Panipat was due to the use of fire arms or not the use of musketmen became increasingly commonplace in Indian armies after Babur's invasion."
 maharathan_cavalryDESCR: "After the fall of the Ahmednagar sultanate the Marathas that had previously thrived in its service came to fight in the service of Bijapur and other local or regional powers eager to develop further ways to outsmart the large Mughal armies encroaching on the Deccan. With the rise of Maratha military ability came the rise of Maratha political power and these Deccani warriors would soon form states of their own, overshadowing their former Muslim employers and proving to be a threat to their Mughal nemesis. Through the use of light cavalry and infantry the Marathan armies would be able to harass and cut off much larger and less mobile Mughal forces and carve out a number of empires from the declining Mughal state."
 sikh_rifleDESCR: "Hiring of European officers to train and lead Indian regiments changed the military landscape of India in many ways. Armies using traditional tactics, emphasizing cavalry, were often beaten by forces with drilled musket-armed infantry and mobile artillery. In order to stay ahead it would become essential to organize cavalry, infantry and artillery to fight together to a much greater degree than had previously been seen in India. Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan was one of the states that took this lesson to heart the most and managed to prove that as long as they could be properly coordinated with the other arms light cavalry was still a very powerful tool for disrupting the operations of their opponents in India."
 south_indian_musketeerDESCR: "Vijayanagara and its successor states relied on the local chiefs of the communities of their empire for much of its administration. Among their tasks was the organization of local defense and the recruitment and marshaling of troops."
 sikh_hit_and_runDESCR: "The less prestigious infantry arm would commonly attract third or fourth sons of poor Purbia Rajput families in the northern countryside, deserted Afghan clansmen, Jat farmers, and other groups with poor prospects. Unable to afford horses these groups would adopt the use of firearms as a cheaper way to succeed in the battlefield. While they were given little formal training these self-educated Purbia musketmen would eventually make up the core of a more modern northern Indian army as their use of firearms and eventual use of more modern European infantry tactics allowed them to increasingly make a difference on the battlefields of India."
 indian_rifleDESCR: "The role that the Telingas and Berads filled in the south would eventually be filled by the Purbias in the north. British officers in the service of the East India Company and French adventurers in the service of the Mughals or other Indian rulers became increasingly common as commanders of Indian musket infantry in the north-east. As a result drilled Indian infantry regiments could soon be found in all the armies of the states in the north as well as in mercenary bands. Eventually recruitment would become even more organized and these northern Indian troops, known as Sepoys after the Mughal term for an infantryman would become closely associated with Company rule in India."
 reformed_mughal_musketeerDESCR: "As the Vijayanagara empire fractured into a number of Nayak kingdoms following its defeat at Talicota the local Poligars remained in place as local power holders responsible for recruitment. In some of these successor states the Poligars would acquire an even more independent position than they had under Vijayanagara. Along with the continued shortage of horses this led to an even bigger infantry ratio in the southern armies. Firearms also continued to become more common in the south as well as in the north during the 16th century."
 bhonsle_cavalryDESCR: "The light Maratha cavalry increasingly proved how vulnerable the grand Mughal heavy cavalry armies were if you could cut off their supplies. During the first half of the 18th century as Maratha power grew and as infantry increasingly became organized in the European fashion there came a need for more organized cavalry regiments. From the 1720s and onwards the size and level of organization of Indian cavalry armies would increase to attempt to match the development of infantry and artillery tactics that now took place. It would take some time before seasoned Indian generals would realize just how vulnerable their focus on the cavalry arm could make them against the drilled European-style musket regiments that became increasingly common during the 1700s."
 maharathan_guerilla_warfareDESCR: "As the French became increasingly entangled in the affairs of the south and eastern Indian states they started the practice of training Indian troops to use coordinated European infantry tactics. This would soon prove to be the start of a revolution in Indian warfare as infantry rather than cavalry increasingly came to be the determining factor in battles. Under Dupleix and de Bussy Telegu soldiers started to fight and arm themselves in a manner more similar to the European armies of the time. These troops were known as Telingas after their area of origin (Telingana) but soon the term came to be used about musket armed and uniformed infantry troops in other parts of India."

But since it is impossible to know who is predestined, a notion has developed that it might be possible to discern that a person is predestined by observing their way of life. As hard work, frugality, social success and wealth are thought to be important consequences of being predestined, it seems to inspire followers of the Reformed faith to strive for reaching them, as well as attracting those who already possess them - like burghers and merchants."

 desc_feudalism: "Communism (from Latin communis, 'common, universal') is a left-wing to far-left sociopolitical, philosophical, and economic ideology within the socialist movement, whose goal is the creation of a communist society, a socioeconomic order centered around common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange that allocates products to everyone in the society based on need. A communist society would entail the absence of private property and social classes, and ultimately money and the state (or nation state)."
 desc_renaissance: "Solidarity, Independent Self-Governing Trade Union (Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy „Solidarność”, abbreviated NSZZ „Solidarność” , is a Polish trade union founded in August 1980 at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Poland. Subsequently, it was the first independent trade union in a Warsaw Pact country to be recognised by the state. The union's membership peaked at 10 million in September 1981, representing one-third of the country's working-age population. Solidarity's leader Lech Wałęsa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and the union is widely recognised as having played a central role in the end of Communist rule in Poland."
 desc_new_world_i: "The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has also led to the spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vastness of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic, the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy. With foreign lands and people being mapped and documented, ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate are increasingly being colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth, and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri, the nature of the world is now up for debate."
 desc_printing_press: "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Venetian Printer Aldus Manutius, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout Europe, hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from Religious and Political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 desc_global_trade: "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
 desc_manufactories: "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries have increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent, the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that inhibit mass production as well as pioneer ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 desc_enlightenment: "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever-increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications and coffee houses, kings, scientists, philosophers and littérateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of the ideals of the Enlightenment to all of humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs, expeditions are being sent to measure, catalogue, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Man.\n\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The Light of Reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."

We feed our people with its flesh, we use its bones for tools, we use its fur against the cold during the long winters or its hides for our clothes or to cover our tipis, we use its soul as our symbol animal. Such is the importance of the bison for our culture that we would feel guideless without them."

These tents are durable, provide warmth and comfort in winter, are cool in the heat of the summer and dry during heavy rains. But best of all, they can be disassembled and packed away quickly, so they are perfect for when we need to relocate."

 tribelets: "Tribelets"
 tribelets_desc: "Despite the large density of people in our region, especially when compared with others in the continent, our tribes are rather small, barely consisting of a few dozens of individuals working together.

One of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most expert men approaches and asks [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] which prey [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wants to hunt."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] does not hesitate and follow the man through the woods until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. A big deer, the biggest [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen poses majestic in the middle of a clearing. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] whispers a short 'thank you' to the spirits of the forest for this opportunity that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not miss. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] orders [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men to stay quiet and in their positions as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] starts to silently move towards the best position to fire [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bow. The bow is ready to release the arrow destined to kill the animal. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s breath is calm. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] fingers start to free the arrow."
 native_americans.29.d2: "A woman from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]'s tribe approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is fishing as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tribe usually does to feed their people. [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head towards her, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes meet and [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows she has seen something unusual, but good, nevertheless. With piety in her gaze, she whispers how she has seen the biggest salmon ever, a true incarnation of the spirit of the river we so deeply worship. [Root.Monarch.GetName] follows her to the spot where she saw it and after a few breaths [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally sees it. It is huge indeed. [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tools to capture it."
 native_americans.29.d3: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] was going back home with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe after a good day of seal hunting, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw not far away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position a huge seal, a true blessing from the gods, emerge from the depths of the sea. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] harpoon and quietly moves closer to it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] leaves the row over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe, stand up and have the harpoon ready to be fired. The seal emerges, their gazes contact as [Root.Monarch.GetName] releases the weapon."
 native_americans.29.d4: "The hunting group is coming back home when among the group of pronghorns that comes across [Root.Monarch.GetName], the biggest antelope [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen appears. Almost as if it was a deity, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can feel a special bright aura around it and immediately knows [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to hunt it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] leaves the group behind and move silently to sneak the animal. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is ready, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, hoping to not miss the chance."
 native_americans.29.d5: "The land trembles as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets closer to the herd of bison. These animals can kill anyone with their gore attacks with ease, but they are also life for our people. Suddenly, among them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can see a massive male that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows has to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for this unequal fight before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors with a quick pray. The opportunity emerges right in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tries."

Although it is not as deadly as a spear or arrow, the boomerang is a reliable and reusable hunting tool and a deadly weapon in the hands of a skilled warrior. The reduced fatality rate of a boomerang makes it the ideal tool for battles where the aim is to take prisoners, not inflict casualties."

 TIW_yiminga_desc: "Our skin, or “Yiminga” is matrilineal and is carried down from mother to her children. It is the female dynasties which determine the fate of our children; their group, life, spirit, breath, and pulse. The female brings life and form to the child, and the male locates a spirit to bring for the unborn child. While other tribes would scorn the efforts of the females, we know it is from them that our social class and family is determined, and it is only right that they share a place in power with their male counterparts."
 TIW_dreaming_totem: "The Dreaming Totem"
 TIW_dreaming_totem_desc: "The dreaming totem of a Tiwi is a sacred animal assigned to a Tiwi by their father. A Tiwi with a totem may not kill or consume the flesh of their spirit animal; to do so would be the spiritual cannibalism. It’s an integral part of a Tiwi’s individual identity and is used as a mark of identity during dances and ceremonies."

Purrukapali, distressed by what had happened, picked up the dried corpse of his boy and carried him to the wise Japara who promised to restore the boy to life in time, but Purrukapali in a fit of distress and impatience engaged Japara in a great battle. Purrukapali picked up the dead body of his son and carried him into the sea, proclaiming that death should come to all creation so that all would experience the grief he feels. The site where he carried his son became a strong whirlpool that would drown anyone who came near it. Japara, who ended Purrukapali’s madness, was reincarnated into the moon and became trapped in a cycle of death and reincarnation every three days."
 TIW_marriage: "Tiwi Marriage Traditions"
 TIW_marriage_desc: "Marriage is integral for economic, social, and political advantage. Marriage is as important to our livelihood as fishing, farming, and foraging, and a Tiwi woman who is unmarried is simply idle and belligerent. Remarriage is common for our people, and often lower members of society such as low-ranking hunters would often marry the widows of more successful men. Remarriage must happen quickly, for each day a woman remains unmarried is a day of great shame."
 TIW_isolationism: "Tiwi Isolationism"
 TIW_isolationism_desc: "Our society has a long history of harsh isolationism. Outsiders have only sought to plunder and take advantage of our bountiful lands and destroy our culture and this must not be allowed to pass.

 aborig_walkabout_desc: "The traditional Aboriginal Walkabout is a ceremony in which an Aboriginal boy is expected to journey across the harsh Australian wilderness to a holy site such as Uluru, and it is on his journey that he transitions from boy to man. The journey can last as long as six months, and in this time, the man is expected to live out in the wilderness without any outside assistance. It is a hard passage to go through, but it ensures that only the strongest amongst us survives."

But, nonetheless, the Aboriginals were able to survive in such harsh conditions and even make lives for themselves out there. "
 aborig_sacred: "The Sacred Lands"
 aborig_sacred_desc: "The Aboriginal religious beliefs often assign divine significance to all places in Australia. Notable landmarks and features across the continent are often described as being the resting places for the gods, or relics of ancient conflicts that took place during the Dreamtime. The Rainbow Serpent, which is often seen as a creator god, is claimed to be the bringer of rain, and when a rainbow appears in the sky, it is the rainbow serpent moving from one watering hole to another."
 aborig_dreamtime: "Dreamtime"
 aborig_dreamtime_desc: "The Dreamtime refers to the time before the creation of the universe; when all that existed were spirits and gods. Different tribes have differing explanations for what brought the world into existence from the Dreamtime, but almost all tribes in Australia believed in this time before material existence. To practice meditation or worship of gods and ancestors is often described as “Dreaming”, and tapping into the knowledge of the Dreamtime scape. This is because in the Dreamtime, one’s entire ancestry exists as one, and the knowledge of your ancestors is readily available in the Dreamtime if one is able to access it."
 aborig_music: "Musical Tradition"
 aborig_music_desc: "Aboriginal music is distinctly unique in its composition. The digeridoo is a traditional instrument used in Aboriginal music, and prior to the arrival of the colonists, Australia would be the only place one could hear the tones of this unique instrument. There are songs and compositions created by the aboriginals that are as old as 1500 years and are still played today. "
 aborig_fire_stick_farming: "Fire-stick Farming"
 aborig_fire_stick_farming_desc: "Australia is a harsh and unforgiving land, but we’ve learned to exploit the Bush to its maximum potential.

We are experts at navigating the small shores and natural harbors of our homeland and shall continue to survive with this coastal way of life."
 EOR_bands: "Twenty-Nine Bands"
 EOR_bands_desc: "The Eora are a collection of 29 different bands of people. The bands are united by common ancestors and families, and intermarriage between bands is common and keeps our disparate people strong and united. Administrating these major bands and uniting our nation together in this loose government style will prove useful as our tribe continues to expand and more people come to call themselves Eora."
 EOR_enduring: "Enduring Culture"
 EOR_enduring_desc: "The culture of Eora is ancient beyond any knowledge, and has endured through war, conquest, and changing times. Eora artwork and culture can exist and thrive in the smallest of our villages to the vast expansive cities of the future. As times change and people of increasing number come to join our nation, one thing shall always endure; the Eora spirit."
 EOR_protect: "Protect the Ancestral Land"
 EOR_protect_desc: "The Aboriginal people of Sydney were stoic defenders of their homeland and would resist the offenses of foreign invaders against their land, even against their own self-interest. In many wars and conflicts which have come to the shores of Australia, Eora men and women would eagerly volunteer to fight and defend their land; even during times when they were seen as second-class citizens. It’s our willingness to fight and defend the sacred land which rallies new generations constantly to our cause."
 EOR_sacred: "The Sacred Shore"
 EOR_sacred_desc: "We are the traditional custodians of this sacred land. While other tribes would abandon their homes in a heartbeat for more fertile lands, we Eora have always been here and always will be here. Our 29 nations live together in harmony around the Sydney harbor, and the co-operation of our people is what will make Eora lands the envy of the world."
 EOR_pemulwuy: "Pemulwuy"
 EOR_pemulwuy_desc: "When the colonists came to visit the Eora, they rapidly began plundering our shores of fish, emptying our land of wildlife, and polluting our waters with filth. The Eora lifestyle was coming to an end. However, brave warriors like Pemulwuy would stand against these foreign invaders and end their disruptive behavior. The ferocity and bravery displayed by Pemulwuy shall prove as an example to all, and the Eora people will fight even against impossible odds."
 EOR_berewaldal: "Berewaldal"
 EOR_berewaldal_desc: "There are people from beyond our lands; beyond even Australia itself. We know they envy the lucrative produce that Eora has to offer, and we know that one way or another they will find a way to take it from us. Perhaps it is not with violence, but with clever words that we may negotiate with these outsiders and find a solution that will be good for both of our people."

 KAU_coastal_pangkarra: "Coastal Pangkarra"
 KAU_coastal_pangkarra_desc: "Along with being autonomous and minimally governed, all Pangkarra must be granted access to the sea by birthright. Fishing and maritime trade are a vital part of the Kaurna lifestyle and any Pangkarra without coastal access is no Pangkarra at all."
 KAU_redgum_shelters: "Redgum Shelters"
 KAU_redgum_shelters_desc: "While other societies are sedentary and soft, the Kaurna people move with the passing of the seasons. In summer, the ocean overflows with fish, but in winter the rains come and the maintenance of fires in our Redgum Shelters becomes vital for our survival."
 KAU_communal_ownership: "Communal Ownership"
 KAU_communal_ownership_desc: "No individual has the right to claim ownership of that which belongs to the Kaurna people. Property belongs not to landowners or nobility, but to the tribe and the people who inhabit it. This communal ownership ensures that no man or woman is left behind, and the tribe prospers or suffers as one."
 KAU_old_tjilbruke: "Old Tjilbruke"
 KAU_old_tjilbruke_desc: "Our people share the story of Tjilbruke; a great hero of the Kaurna tribe from the time of the Dreaming. Tjilbruke brought peace to the Kaurna people with his laws and proclamations which kept our people safe.

 PLW_oyster: "Oyster Bay"
 PLW_oyster_desc: "The Great Oyster Bay is an area on our island rich with oysters, mussels, scallops, urchins and countless other easily harvestable maritime goods. Even whales and fur seals would occasionally wander to Palawan shores and bring with them the great bounty of their meats, bone, and fur. Our island truly is a blessed land, and we have mastered the harvesting of sites like Oyster Bay for their great bounty and know how to trade them with other tribes for great profit."
 PLW_dual_identity: "Dual-Identity"
 PLW_dual_identity_desc: "The Palawa identity can be broken down into two hierarchies; the domestic unit of families, and the clan unit which would be a separate clan of 40-50 people, and both identities would exist under the hierarchy of the tribe."
 PLW_darwin: "Darwin Glass"
 PLW_darwin_desc: "Unknown centuries ago, our island was struck with a great monument from the gods which landed squarely in the centre of our island. Though it caused great destruction, it also brought with it a powerful building material ideal for crafting into spears and jewellery. Our island may well be the only site in the world to contain this precious material, and we must capitalize on this through trade and warfare."
 PLW_parlevar: "Parlevar"
 PLW_parlevar_desc: "In the beginning of time, the creators Moinee and Droemerdene set about their work crafting the world. Moinee was the architect of the world; forming land and rivers of our island, and finally taking the wandering spirit of Parlevar and granting him the body of the first man. What followed shortly after was the Kangaroo, which Moinee made in Parlevar’s image, who then emerged from the soil in the ground. Droemerdene took the form of a star and acted as humanity’s guide and transformed these kangaroo-men into human beings; removing their tales and fashioning knees so they may rest. The original human beings were Palawa, and hence any who resist the Palawa identity are merely denying their ancestors."
 PLW_writers: "First Aboriginal Writers"
 PLW_writers_desc: "Though Aboriginal cultures were often defined through oral tradition and visual arts, we Palawa were among the first to adopt the written word as a way of preserving the legacy of the ancestors and sharing the knowledge of our people. Our earliest works included information about the island itself, our history, and great works of poetry written in Palawa languages. Our quick mastery of the written word is a clear demonstration that we Palawa are expert at embracing new ideas and shifting our old traditions to flow with the changing times."
 PLW_survivors: "Survivors of the Black War"
 PLW_survivors_desc: "When the colonists came to our island, they sought to eradicate our people and take our lands. The conflict was bloody, and almost eradicated all life on our island. We fought bravely against a superior foe; refusing to back down with gun barrels pointed to our heads."
 PLW_enduring: "Enduring People"
 PLW_enduring_desc: "After the bloody conflicts with foreign colonial armies, only four hundred Palawa were left alive to continue our legacy. Over the years, our numbers would begin to multiply again until we regained our original population.

It is from these enraptured listeners that we are descended, and the voyager spirit is something that exists at the very heart of our people."
 kaitiakitanga: "Kaitiakitanga"
 kaitiakitanga_desc: "Kaikiatitanga is the sacred guardianship that all Maori owe to the sky, the sea, and the land. One who practices this tradition is Kaitiaki or guardian and is a sacred guardian who defends the inanimate forces of Mana that surround us but are incapable of defending themselves. To desecrate a holy site is considered equivalent to murder in Maori society, so harmful acts such as polluting a river, chopping down a forest, or excessively plundering natural resources are considered sin without measure. It is only by living in harmony with our environment and restricting ourselves on how much we encroach on nature is the only way to please the Gods and grow rich with Mana."
 kaumatua: "Kaumatua"
 kaumatua_desc: "Although we are not ruled by the elder council, they are highly influential in our society. A Kaumatua is elected by their family for their supreme intellect, wisdom, and renown to ensure that the family and Iwi as a whole continues to maintain the sacred traditions valued to the Maori. Kaumatua holds the soul of an immortal demi-god who possesses the power of reincarnation, and have existed across countless lifetimes, and may return at any moment to give the family guidance."
 kapa_haka: "Kapa Haka"
 kapa_haka_desc: "The Kapa Haka is a series of stomps and chants, most comparable to a war-dance. The dance is typically performed by warriors as they approach a battle, as an attempt to bolster friendly morale as well as intimidate their enemies. The dance demonstrates strength and prowess, while belittling the strength and prowess of their enemy."
 pa_defence: "Pa Defense"
 pa_defence_desc: "A Pa is a Maori village built in a highly defensible position. Similar to European castles, a Pa is constructed to ensure the continued survival of the local people during wartime. Pa are strong and defensive, but inexpensive and can be built and maintained for little more than a standard village, so while our enemies wait and starve outside our gates, we may continue to prosper within the walls of our mighty fortified village."
 te_moko: "Te Moko"
 te_moko_desc: "The art of the tattoo is a tradition practiced widely across our lands. A man is hardly a man if he has not felt the mark of ink on his flesh. We mark these tattoos into our skin with chisels, as we are as tough and unmoving as stone, and we welcome the scars they leave behind. To be marked with traditional tattoos is a sign of great strength and prestige, and causes the weak foreigners to tremble as we charge towards them; our faces blessed by the markings of our gods and ancestors."
 maori_king: "The Maori King Movement"
 maori_king_desc: "In 1858, by popular demand, a Maori king was elected to represent, but not rule over, all other Iwi. Though some rejected the authority of this democratically selected King, many Maori flocked to the King's cause as a way of preventing the alienation of Maori land by the British colonists. Just as Victoria ruled over all the Brits, this king would rule over all the Maori and allow equal negotiations with the Europeans with a unified voice."

 fijian_crossroad: "Crossroad of Cultures"
 fijian_crossroad_desc: "For centuries, Fiji has been a resting point for countless migrators and voyagers throughout the pacific. We exist between many civilizations and as such, we have influenced them as much as they have influenced us. We must learn to accept these people and integrate them into our culture, so that the Fijian way of life may continue to evolve with changing times."
 fijian_degel: "Lutunasobasoba and Degel"
 fijian_degel_desc: "Kaunitoni was the legendary vessel which carried out ancestors Lutunasobasoba and Degel from distant lands in the West, to the sacred shores of Fiji. It was when they reached our island that they split into two tribes, Lutunasobasoba becoming chief of the West, and Degel chief of the East."
 fijian_conjoined: "Conjoined Society"
 fijian_conjoined_desc: "It has been said that Fijian society and religion are conjoined, and that any attempt to separate the two would result in irreparable damage to them both. While the separation of church and state may sound progressive in theory, in reality the very laws which govern our daily lives come from the wisdom of the great prophets and the Gods. While we accept cultures different from our own, if these people are to live here, they must come to understand our Gods and spirits if they are to call themselves Fijian."
 fijian_waqa: "Waqa Drua"
 fijian_waqa_desc: "The Drua is a canoe designed by our ancestors to carry our people across the ocean and wage war at sea. The Waqa Drua is the largest and finest seafaring vessel in all the known world, and other kingdoms tremble as they witness our vast ship's approach. Our mastery of ship craft and naval warfare has kept Fiji safe from foreign invaders, and so long as our mighty oceangoing armies maintain our long naval tradition, Fiji shall maintain its sovereignty."
 fijian_warlords: "Fijian Warlords"
 fijian_warlords_desc: "The mountainous nature of our islands have made it difficult to consolidate the different clans together and due to this fragmentation, fights over the territory are a constant thing. This means that a part of our society is constantly clashing other groups, so they are used to war."
 fijian_kai: "Kai Colo"
 fijian_kai_desc: "We are hardy people, our warriors train in the harsh mountain climates of Fiji. Kai Colo are the mountainous people of Fiji and produce the finest and hardiest warriors our islands have to offer. We do not suffer in the face of adverse climates, and we are adaptable to all terrain. During the war, the Kai Colo held out in their mountainous homes against a foe far more advanced than them. This was a battle that determined the continued existence of the Kai Colo, and unsurprisingly, our superior warriors won out in the end."
 fijian_confederacy: "Confederacy of Kingdoms"
 fijian_confederacy_desc: "When we Fijians were coming to formalize our disparate governments, one such proposal was that all existing kingdoms of Fiji be unified into a Confederacy of Kings, each holding some autonomy while still being unified under a single governing body. This method of granting our people local autonomy promotes local trade and creates a more prospering society for all."

 kapu_system: "Preserving the Kapu System"
 kapu_system_desc: "The Kapu system is the ancient Hawaiian system of laws which rule lifestyle, gender roles, religion, and the governing of the isles. The Kapu is a religious law, and enforces the will of the Gods upon the people. It also protects the holy sites of Hawaii and prevents the afforestation and plundering of our nation's precious resources for expedient pleasure. None are exempt from the Kapu; not commoners, not merchants, not foreign visitors, and not even the King."
 alii_nui: "Repurposing the Ali'i Nui"
 alii_nui_desc: "The Ali'i are the ruling class of Hawaii, and the Ali'i Nui is the individual who rules the ruling class. The Ali'i Nui were for a long time considered the highest members of society, with no individuals or institutions outranking them. With the unification of Hawaii, we cannot simply depose the old rulers of these regions, but rather we can redefine the meaning of Ali'i Nui into a secular position appointed by the King of Hawaii, solidifying our position without upsetting the Ali'i."
 hula_idea: "Hula"
 hula_idea_desc: "The Hula is a traditional dance often accompanied by an Oli Chant of a Mele Song. The Hula is more than a mere dance or performance, however. It is the medium by which we preserve our history, our culture, and tell stories of our ancestors and gods. The Oli or Mele describes the events as they happened with words, and the Hula translates those words into physical movement. The movement of our bodies and hands represent the literal words spoken or sung by the Oli and Mele, but also may represent the events of the story such as the flowing of the waves or the intense emotions of the legendary heroes of old."
 ohana: "Ohana"
 ohana_desc: "Ohana is the Hawaiian concept of family, and has long extended beyond mere blood relation. A family takes many forms, and adopted family is of equal importance to blood family. It was common practice for a great ruler to adopt trusted friends and allies into his or her family and treat them as kin, and our malleable concept of family makes Hawaiian society one which may welcome foreigners and strangers with brotherly arms."
 kanawai_mamalahoe: "Kanawai Mamalahoe"
 kanawai_mamalahoe_desc: "'Oh people, Honor thy god; respect alike people both great and humble; May everyone, from the old men and women to the children Be free to go forth and lie in the road Without fear of harm. Break this law, and die.' This is the Law of the Splintered Paddle laid out by King Kamehameha, and is the backbone of our society. The law is revolutionary and values the sanctity of all Human life, even that of our enemies, ensuring that the weak and innocent are protected from the devastation and hardships of war."
 naha_prophecy: "Naha Prophecy"
 naha_prophecy_desc: "The Naha Prophecy dictates that the man or woman who can lift the Naha Stone is the rightful ruler of all Polynesia. Our ruler has fulfilled this prophecy, and while some may deny our right to rule Polynesia, they will soon know that the divine blood of our royal line has long been destined to unite our people as one, and bring Polynesia to global prominence."
 legendary_voyagers: "Legendary Voyagers"
 legendary_voyagers_desc: "The sheer number of ancestors across Polynesia who claim they originated from Hawaii are too many to count. It can't be denied that voyaging, exploration, and colonization is in the very blood of the Hawaiian people. We hear the open ocean calling us, and we obey. Using the ancient navigational techniques of following the migration of birds and the positions of the stars in the sky, we Hawaiians can venture to the edge of the Earth and back, bringing knowledge and riches back to the shores of our magnificent home."

 tonga_pulotu: "Pulotu's Creation"
 tonga_pulotu_desc: "In the beginning, Pulotu pulled the great rock Touia'o Futuna from the infinite plane of ocean. On this new land emerged four sets of twins of opposite sexes, and each brother laid with his sister and their divine blood would produce four holy daughters. Our most ancient of ancestors bind all people together, and what better nation to keep the descendants of these people alive than the Tonga? Surely, our network of tributaries and subjects will understand that it is our brotherly and sisterly love of one-another that brings us closest to the ancient gods and ancestors."
 tonga_maui: "The Islands of Maui"
 tonga_maui_desc: "It is from Manuka in Samoa where Maui would receive his legendary fishing hook from none other than Tonga Fusifonua. When the great hero Maui went to fish in the ocean with this hook, he did not pull a fish from the ocean, but our home island of Tongatapu was dragged up from the bottom of the sea! As Maui continued to fish with this magical hook, he birthed ‘Eua and the many other smaller islands of our great kingdom, and even some of the isles of Fiji and Samoa as well. But it is Tongatapu, the capital island of our nation, that was the first of Maui's islands, and surely the divine nature of our land's birth that will attract even more merchants, settlers, and nobles to our shores."
 tonga_polynesian: "True Claimants to Polynesia"
 tonga_polynesian_desc: "While the other pacific Islanders embrace the winds of change as foreigners come to our shores, or indeed we come to foreign shores, we do not cave to the ways of others. As Tongans, we stand proud of our voyaging heritage, and remain as headstrong and resilient as a rock in the face of changing tides. We shall ensure our people continue to keep the Tongan identity alive."
 tonga_tongatapu: "The Bells of Tongatapu"
 tonga_tongatapu_desc: "We boast the highest ratio of people-to-temples in all the world. As one sails close to the shores of Tongatapu, among the whispering of the waves, one can hear the chime of bells and the gentle prayers of the faithful. Whether we choose to practice our old religion, or the emerging faiths from overseas, our faith shall bind us Tongans together, and everyone shall have a place to properly worship their gods."
 tonga_craftsman: "Ancient Tongan Craftsmanship"
 tonga_craftsman_desc: "We have an ancient tradition of bone carving, wood carving, and basket making. Our practices predate any records, and our great craftsmen have passed their trade down from generation to generation for so long that one could believe it is in our very blood."
 tonga_oceanic_empire: "The Oceanic Empire"
 tonga_oceanic_empire_desc: "Tonga is home to over 170 islands, with a people all connected by our ancient traditions and customs. Beyond that, the Tongan Empire collects its tributes from Samoa and Fiji, and many nations beyond our shores. With the brilliance and ingenuity we possess to keep a people unified across such an endless ocean, there is no nation better than the Tongan Empire to spread out across Oceania."

Music is a universal language all people understand, and it is with our mastery of the musical language that we shall find unity."
 samoa_faa: "Fa'a Samoa"
 samoa_faa_desc: "Fa'a Samoa is the ancient guideline for all Samoans on how to lead their lives, and how to rule their people.  The three structural elements of Fa'a Samoa liein the Matai or nobility, Aiga or family, and the clergy. There are over 18,000 noble families living on our various islands, and all follow the simple philosophy of Fa'a Samoa. It was by codifying what it means to be Samoan that we can maintain a kingdom that spans countless disparate islands across the sea."
 samoa_mauluulu: "Maulu'ulu"
 samoa_mauluulu_desc: "The Maulu'ulu is an ancient traditional dance practiced primarily by Samoan women, although many villages would have the men and women dance together. The dance is an artistic expression of everyday life in Samoa; imitating the motions of domestic duties, farming, fishing, and traditional customs. It is with this that we bind the activities of everyday life to our culture and make them transcendent."
 samoa_foreign: "Acceptance of the Foreign Missionaries"
 samoa_foreign_desc: "Although we wish to preserve our culture and heritage, it is irrefutable that these missionaries and prophets that come from overseas carry with them wisdom far beyond what we already possess. Perhaps by allowing them to stay and practice their ways, we may absorb some of that wisdom into our own society. A little western influence couldn't hurt. "
 samoa_tatau: "Tatau"
 samoa_tatau_desc: "The ancient art of the Tatau is practiced widely throughout the Polynesian Triangle. Master Tatau artists practice their craft with tools made from bones, tusk, teeth, shell, and wood. The process is long, arduous, and painful, but we do it to decorate our bodies with venerations to our ancestors and gods; showing a man's spirituality and commitment to the Samoan way of life."
 samoa_faavae: "Fa'avae I Le Atua Samoa"
 samoa_faavae_desc: "The religious practices of our people vary wildly in doctrine and denomination, but all are bound by the phrase “Samoa is founded on God”. It matters not what religion we practice, for it is Samoa itself which is holy among all gods. Sunday is a day of great rest for all Samoans, to worship their respective gods in the way they choose and spend time amongst their family. It matters not what faith you follow, for all are accepted in Fa'a Samoa."
 samoa_trade: "Polynesian Triangle Trade"
 samoa_trade_desc: "For years, Samoan traders have been involved in trading across the Polynesian Triangle; primarily with Fiji and Tonga, our close neighbors. Many societies would merely abandon the notion of trade across such a vast ocean, but our voyagers and traders understand the way of the waves better than any others. No matter the size of our nation, we shall remember the navigational techniques that brought riches to Samoa, and perhaps someday Samoa will reap the rich trade goods from all over the world…"

Polynesian traders and voyagers alike would utilize the Polynesian Triangle to engage in trade, exploration, and colonization. The native Polynesians would actually refer to this region as an octopus, representing the various invisible pathways that navigators would follow along the sea.

This is a big insult and the youngster knows that. Despite his beggings and promises to repay the harm done, some voices advice [Root.Monarch.GetName] to kill him to clean the shame for the dynasty. Of course, there are others fearing a possible uprising from his clan should we kill their future ruler."

Their demands started as gossip; someone whispers that this or that person is not happy with the direction of the nation, another says that the leading faction is not as strong as this other, or that they are not as represented in the regency as they should and so on. Those gossips have continued for weeks and their presence in the court is totally obvious nowadays, to the point that the faction challenging our regent's power is absolutely vocal about it. The regent is worried, for obvious reasons, and sees that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own faction's power has been weakened to the point of doubting that it can fight back. It is the moment to make a decision that will change our nation."

Unchallenged and drunk with power, the faction behind our regent, and probably [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] too, is pressing to be granted some privileges. As we are in a position of weakness, refusing to accept their demands can be a dangerous move, and we might be choosing a path to our own damnation. On the other hand, if they managed to cement their power, they might be difficult to remove, should they refuse to step away from lead once we have a proper ruler."

Our regent, [Root.Monarch.GetName], thinks being in power is a golden opportunity to get rid of some political enemies and adversaries. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] is using [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power as a regent to mercilessly attack any voice that speaks against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] or [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] faction or even when they do not, just because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can. Of course, the other factions are not specially happy with how things are being done and might try to retaliate. We are in a crossroad where we have to decide what to do, should we intervene?"

 estate_regency_events.5.d: "It is said that burghers only care about money. As long as money is abundant, they are happy and will not cause many problems. At least, that is what we thought. [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] faction have used their power to further advance some shady businesses while they are in power. Smuggling is nothing new to us, we know it and it would not be the first time we turn our eyes blind to this, but this time these illicit moves have irritated another nation, and they might use this incident as an excuse to declare war on us and get some compensations. Unfortunately, they are not willing to negotiate."

And this is exactly the situation [Root.GetName] is facing. The clergy in charge is using their power to remove the influence of other religions in our realm and their power is too big to refuse. A timid protest is all we have been able to elevate. We will change this policy in the future, no doubt, but for now we will need to live with it."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] is an exception to the rule.

This would not be strange, but for the sole reason that everytime [Root.Monarch.GetName] goes through those halls, silence becomes tangible. It is not the common silence derived from respect, but an uncomfortable silence that makes everyone feel uneasy.

As the [Root.GetAdjective] state has failed to deal with this crisis, local governors have taken matters into their own hands. They have raised armies to combat the rebels, but they are refusing to take orders from our generals. Our messengers report that they intend to continue to administer their feudatory states even after the crisis is over.

No doubt this Dalai Lama is simply grasping to the last vestiges of his broken power. With Tibet now under [Root.GetAdjective] rule there was no real need to negotiate with the old order. Yet many chieftains among the Mongols had embraced the Buddhist faith and looked to the Lama for spiritual guidance, and so the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was compelled to attend.\n\nMuch to the surprise of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Dalai Lama has made a truly interesting offer.

 flavor_fra.EVTDESC100: "There has been an attempt on the life of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The royalist conspirators concealed their bomb in a barrel on a cart parked on the Rue Saint-Nicaise, where Napoléon had to pass on the way to the Opera to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' Nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', the bomb was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion killed several bystanders but failed to hurt Napoléon."

 flavor_fra.EVTNAME101: "Aspirations of an Empire"
 flavor_fra.EVTDESC101: "Not satisfied with being merely First Consul, Napoléon Bonaparte is proposing that he be crowned Emperor of the French. He justifies this by claiming that restoring the hereditary succession would make it harder to restore the former kings of France to power - after all, there have been several royalist plots on his life - but there is little doubt that his prime motivation is to further his own ambitions for supreme power. The proposal has met with widespread support among the populace, who yearn for the relative stability of the pre-revolutionary years; however, diehard supporters of the Revolution express worry at this attempt to concentrate even more power in Napoléon's hands."

Many are increasingly losing faith in the Republic as a result."

 flavor_fra.EVTDESC113: "The national debt is a problem in the eyes of the people. The country's finances seem to be in no better shape than before the shift of government, and many fear a costly default or rising taxes. The faith in the Republic is dwindling and many are turning back to old monarchist ways."

The ever-increasing turmoil afflicting our nation is causing widespread suffering among the peasantry and upper classes alike. Support is growing for a strong leader to take over control and enforce an end to the chaos."

As the old Muslim aristocrats and clergy remain very influential in our country and still hold many positions of power within our state this is not a small problem. It has been suggested that perhaps the situation might be defused by [Root.Monarch.GetName] abdicating in favor of a relative who would then convert to Islam. This would allow power to remain with the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family while still placating the Ulema and leading aristocrats.

These units showed their worth at the battle of Adrianople when the last great crusade (with the cream of Latin nobility) were shattered by the Ottoman light cavalry and Janissaries. To counter this the Hungarian army had a number of units termed Hussars which were lighter cavalry more suited to fighting their Ottoman opponents. However the units that first arrived in the west were not the light Hungarian Hussars, but the heavier Polish Winged Hussars which were a mixture of orthodox cavalry and light raiding Cavalry."

Later Jaeger became a generic name for all kinds of light infantry. Jaeger troops were often hired as mercenaries by other nations, such as Great Britain who used them in the American Revolution."
 austrian_tercioDESCR: "The Tercio, or Spanish Square, was a mixed formation of pikemen and musketeers developed by the Spanish General Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba.

However, the Tercio were still evolving and through experimentation it was found that the number of pikemen required could be reduced. These late tercios could have as little as 25% pikemen leading to a massive increase in the formations' firepower."
 austrian_white_coatDESCR: "Having its beginning on the Habsburg military frontier fighting the Ottoman cavalry based armies. The White Coats were drilled and equipped primarily to resist cavalry charges. They were not as effective against musket equipped infantry or on the offensive, but still useful against strong cavalry based armies."
 aztec_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "The introduction of gunpowder weapons into the new world by the Europeans did not change the overall tactics of new world warfare, only the technology used. The hill musketeer remained a primarily defensive unit, but the tactics used did more damage to enemy morale than the mountain warrior."
 aztec_hill_warfareDESCR: "The hardy hill warrior was not immune to technological change. With new weapons and tactics, these soldiers began to evolve from an offensive unit to a unit that placed a higher premium on defense. However, the unit's main means of victory was to hit the enemy's morale."
 aztec_tribal_warfareDESCR: "In the high plateau of Mexico, the Aztec Empire was founded. The dynamics of Aztec culture required on-going military conquests and military units began to evolve into specialized attacking units, which also placed great worth at staying power in combat."

 british_squareDESCR: "During the war of the Austrian Succession, Austria was facing a serious defeat. Silesia had already been lost to Prussia and total defeat was not far away. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units from the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The loose order of infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield. However there were those that totally rejected the skirmisher concept and went for rigid linear tactics. Christened Square Infantry due to the formation they assumed when defending against cavalry. These were tightly disciplined units trained to fire their muskets at a high rate and fire by platoon which meant that rather than use the single volley and reload style during combat, these units would always have a platoon discharging their muskets. The deadly ripple fire could break any assault. However, rigid linear tactics made these units less mobile and more defensive."
 british_hussarDESCR: "As Cavalry became more specialized, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the Polish Hussar that had first entered European warfare and more like the Hungarian Original. The ability of the light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, overrun their artillery positions and when they were beaten, pursue them."
 british_redcoatDESCR: "The Red Coat has its origins in the British army, where the small size of the army meant it was important to husband your resources. Trained and drilled to withstand fire attacks, these troops relied on sheer staying power to keep them in the fight."

 early_carrackDESCR: "The early carrack was the first European vessel which could sail on the high seas of the Atlantic Ocean. The design of this late medieval ship combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense."
 carrackDESCR: "The design of the carrack, a late medieval ship, combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense. Some carracks such as the English vessel 'Henri Grâce à Dieu' weighed more than 1,000 tons, had large fore and aft castles, and could be considered as the greatest warships of their time."
 caravelDESCR: "The caravel was a small, very maneuverable ship which could sail with a high precision on long discovery journeys. Although designs varied, a caravel had a foresail, a square mainsail and lateen mizzen. Its smaller size limited the number of guns onboard, but it also meant that this light ship could explore shallow coastal waters and estuaries. Vasco Da Gama, Cabot, Columbus and Magellan used caravels during their late 15th century and early 16th century voyages."

 durrani_swivelDESCR: "Cavalry units mounted with highly portable swivel cannons on their backs, allowing the troops to fire over their own infantry."
 dutch_mauricianDESCR: "In the 16th century, the musket (a handheld firearm) became commonplace, but they were very slow to reload. Army tacticians typically deployed musket-men in formations to maximize firepower. The muskets would thus be arranged in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. This maximized the firepower of the 16th century muskets and overcame their disadvantage of slow reloading. It was Maurice of Nassau who pioneered the use of these musket formations and taught it to Dutch troops in the Eighty Years' War. His development of military strategy and tactics made the Dutch army the most modern in Europe."
 early_frigateDESCR: "With the increasing overseas trade, there was a need for a fast escort vessel to provide safe journey. The early frigates were developed for this. They were smaller, leaner ships of war with one gun deck, and provided protection from piracy in dangerous waters."

And it became one of the most commonly used ships in the 16th and 17th century. The standard design wasn't armed but when needed it could be armed with cannons and serve as auxiliary vessels."
 french_carabinierDESCR: "The Carabiniers first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiniers main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."
 french_caracolleDESCR: "In the late 16th and early 17th century the most common combat formation for western European cavalry was the Caracole, which could be employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged frontally against the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."
 french_cuirassierDESCR: "The Cuirassiers was a type of heavy cavalry that emerged in the late 15th century. This type of cavalry was armored from his head down to knee-level. His body was protected with a breastplate, the Cuirass from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords. Cuirassiers were mostly used as shock-cavalry and were in use during almost the whole time span focused upon in this game."
 french_bluecoatDESCR: "Having its origins in the French armies of Louis XIV. The Blue Coat infantry displays special elan on the attack. Perfect for leaders who believe that the offensive will always triumph over the defensive."
 french_dragoonDESCR: "In the 17th century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon. Dragoons were widely used by all European nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 french_impulseDESCR: "During the war of the Austrian Succession, Austria was facing a serious defeat. Silesia had already been lost to Prussia and total defeat was not far away. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units for the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 frigateDESCR: "As time passed, the frigate evolved. It became larger and heavily armed, sometimes with two gun decks. The frigate's combination of speed and firepower meant that it could outrun any ship with more guns and outgun any faster ships. The fleet built by the Commonwealth of England in the 1650s consisted almost exclusively of frigates."
 gaelic_free_shooterDESCR: "The development of better firearms forced a change in tactics for the Gaelic mercenaries. These hardy warriors would now await the first volley from the enemy and then unleash their irresistible charge."
 gaelic_galloglaighDESCR: "The galloglaigh were mercenary bands from the Hebrides who mixed traditional Gaelic and Norse styles of warfare to great effect. Like many Gaelic warriors before them, the galloglaigh used the two-handed battle-axe, but were also well-armored in the Norse style with chain mail and helmets. They appeared in Ireland from the mid thirteenth century and soon became highly sought-after warriors in the service of the great Irish chiefs, right through to the sixteenth century. The Galloglaigh fought alongside their retainers in what was known as a 'spar', consisting of the warrior, his kern (a gaelic squire armed with pike or javelin) and his horse-boy (armed with a shortbow or a sheaf of darts). Collectively these spars would group in war-bands, or Corrughadh, which could number over a hundred strong. The galloglaigh were feared by the English as, whilst no match for a heavy medieval army in the open field, they proved a deadly force in small, close confrontations. As a result they were often used by Irish lords as shock troops in ambush situations. These Hebridean warriors did also find success on the open battlefield, most notably at Bannockburn in 1314."
 gaelic_mercenaryDESCR: "As gunpowder weaponry and drill techniques spread through Europe the traditional Scottish and Irish methods of warfare began to become obsolete - the time of the war bands and the galloglaigh was coming to an end. However Scottish and Irish mercenaries were still feared as fighters, especially by the invading English armies. Those who adapted to the new techniques were highly valued for their bravery and courage, notably the Redshanks of Scotland and the Buanadha (quartered men) of Ireland. After the 16th century many Scottish and Irish mercenaries could also be found in armies throughout Europe, notably during the Thirty Years War."
 galleassDESCR: "The galleass was an adaptation of the large merchant galley to counter the increasing use of man-of-war. Larger than the galley, the galleass had about 32 oar pairs, each oar manned by up to five man. As an answer to the men-of-war's armament and higher sides, the galleass had forecastles and aftcastles and gundecks above the rowers. This extra weight meant that they also had to rely more on sails, and were slower and less maneuverable compared to galleys. Like the galley, the galleass went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 galleonDESCR: "A large, usually three-masted sailing ship originally designed as a warship but later on used primarily for trade and commerce."
 galleyDESCR: "With roots back to the ancient ships of the antiquity, the galley remained the prime choice for Mediterranean naval warfare until the 16th century. The galley was primarily propelled by oars, usually about 25 pairs manned by up to three men each. This meant that they were less dependent on wind gauge compared to sailing ships, and their maneuverability made them a feared adversary. Eventually, the galley went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 germanized_pikeDESCR: "When the Goths defeated the Romans at the battle of Adrianople, it heralded a new era in European warfare. Cavalry became the dominant force on the battlefield and infantry relegated to supplying a base for Cavalry to maneuver round. The English victories in the Hundred Years War, although with infantry armies, relied on defensive tactics. However the Swiss Pikemen of the late 15th century gave infantry an offensive role once again. This was quickly noticed by countries in Eastern Europe and German mercenaries were invited over to teach these new tactics."
 han_bannerDESCR: "Ming infantry troops armed with muskets that were incorporated into the banner system originally created by the Manchus during the 17th century."
 heavy_frigateDESCR: "Two decked vessels normally carrying about 40 guns."
 houfniceDESCR: "It is believed modern howitzers have their name from the Houfnice artillery developed by the Hussites in the 15th century. These short barreled guns were mounted on wagons and used on the field of battle to fire balls and canisters in support of the infantry."
 huron_arquebusierDESCR: "The Tomahawk Warrior had a strong emphasis on fire tactics even before the introduction of gunpowder. Embracing the benefits of these weapons, the Native American Arquebusier put strong emphasis on offensive fire and cohesion in combat. It was not as effective at shock action as the offensive musketeer."
 inca_mountain_warfareDESCR: "As new weapons and tactics became available the hardy mountain warriors began to improve. These warriors still placed a premium of defense, relying on their staying power for victory. The improvements in armor and training made victory over these units a tough undertaking."
 irish_chargeDESCR: "The linear descendants of the Gaelic mercenaries of early eras. These units placed maximum emphasis on infantry charges to kill and unnerve their enemies. Their charge could be more devastating than the cavalry of the era making them fearsome in attack."
 iroquois_rifle_scoutDESCR: "The Rifle Scout is a unit that specializes in harassment of the enemy. This unit may not be able to last as long in combat as a more disciplined unit. However these warriors are excellent marksmen and their prowess with the rifle can cause some serious damage to the enemy."
 italian_condottaDESCR: "Condotta is the Italian word for 'contract' and it was used to describe the mercenary units that fought mostly in Italy for the various city-states. The leaders of a Condotta regiment were called Condottiere. The most famous amongst them were Sir John Hawkwood, Francesco Sforza and Bartolomeo Colleoni. Condotta were not very loyal to their employers often switching sides because of higher pay. When Condotta fought each other they also made deals to not harm each other too much and war in Italy often became a sort of theater. Condotta regiments consisted of armored knights and heavy and light infantry and crossbowmen. The Condotta had a monopoly on warfare in Italy which meant that they still used old weapons and tactics when the other European armies already had switched to infantry consisting of musketeers and pikemen."
 japanese_archerDESCR: "The Asian archers were the most important force in Asian battles during this era. The bows were typically made of bamboo but generally longer than the European ones."
 japanese_footsoldierDESCR: "The foot soldiers were the lowest form of warriors within the hierarchy of the time. They consisted of commoners and the lower class nobles, and were the mainstay of the ruler's army. At first, the foot soldiers were only mercenaries and adventurers, and were paid with looted goods but later on they became a core part of the local lord's army. As battles, wars and the larger size of armies became more complex, they were vigorously trained so they could hold their ground against the oncoming enemy forces. Foot soldiers were mostly armed with spears but some did carry swords/katanas and others were used to operate war machinery, as well as being equipped with varying bows. Foot soldiers generally had light armor, consisting of leather pads sown together or a mixture between leather and iron/copper armors. This made them more agile on the battlefield but at times vulnerable against their opponents. In later periods foot soldiers were given firearms as well."
 japanese_samuraiDESCR: "Samurai were the noblemen of the time in Japan. Samurai meant 'to serve'. They were well educated, and were extremely well trained in fighting. They combined their fighting with arts and literature as past times. The Samurai were governed by a codex which was called Bushido meaning 'Way of the Warrior'. If their lord died or lost a war, they would be required to commit Seppuku (self assisted suicide) as part of the Bushido Code. The Samurai were expected to do the same thing and follow their master into the next life. The Samurai was a feared opponent on the battlefield due to them being highly trained in the fighting arts. They could wield a katana with great skill or use the yumi (Japanese longbow) either mounted or on foot."
 large_cast_bronze_mortarDESCR: "The largest cannons of the time were so enormous in size that they required hundreds of men and oxen to move them. They had an immense destruction power but could only fire a limited amount of times during the day due to the difficulties in loading and aiming these beasts."
 large_cast_iron_bombardDESCR: "A larger version of the standard Bombard. This piece of early European siege artillery was designed for launching heavy objects at enemy defenses. A notable example of a Large Bombard is Mons Meg, which was sent as a gift by Philip III of Burgundy to King James II of Scotland in 1453. Although they were devastating weapons, the larger Bombards took a long time to cool down after each firing, meaning they were of limited usefulness on the battlefield and remained largely for use during sieges."
 leather_cannonDESCR: "The Leather Cannon was first used by the armies of King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden during the third Polish-Swedish War. European artillery at this time was too large and heavy to be mobile on a battlefield, and was only really used during sieges. The introduction of a lighter, mobile cannon enabled the Swedes to maneuver their artillery to meet the movements of the enemy and gave them a distinct tactical advantage over their foes. Unfortunately the leather cannon used by the Swedes had a particular weakness which made it highly impractical. Consisting of a narrow copper tube covered in leather strapping and rope, its wrapping caused the cannon to overheat dangerously during continuous use. Nevertheless the Leather Cannon marked the beginning of the development of light field artillery and the concept of taking heavy firepower to the enemy."

 steppe_riders: "Steppe Riders"
 steppe_ridersDESCR: "On the vast expanses of the steppe the cavalry arm would remain dominant far longer than in other regions. As this was primarily due to the extreme mobility possible in that terrain mounted troops would continue to be rather lightly armed even after the introduction of gunpowder weapons. Before the introduction of lighter fire arms bows, swords and light lances remained the weapon of choice for steppe cavalry from Crimea to Manchuria."

 steppe_mounted_raiders: "Mounted Steppe Raiders"
 steppe_mounted_raidersDESCR: "As time progressed both the development of firearms and the tactics to make use of them improved. While they would not out-compete the traditional arms of the steppe Horsemen, firearms would soon be an integrated part of steppe mounted warfare. As cannons got lighter and smaller some could also be brought on horseback to be put to use in the ever changing frontiers of the plains."
 steppe_cavalry: "Steppe Cavalry"
 steppe_cavalryDESCR: "Steppe cavalry would continue to excel at raiding, skirmishing and reconnaissance and many sedentary countries on the border of the Steppes would come to employ Cossacks, Tartars and other Steppe horsemen for these purposes. The free customs of the Steppes would in many ways remain in such units but to a certain degree their existence contributed to a change in organization and a move towards a more modern army structure."
 steppe_uhlans: "Steppe Uhlans"
 steppe_uhlansDESCR: "In time steppe armies would come to rely less on looting and pilaging to cover their operating costs and more on receiving pay from a centralized command. Their tactics still relied on mobility and light arms such as pistols and lances and in open terrain they could still be quite deadly for an unprepared sedentary force but instead of dominating the battlefield on their own they would now often act as a complement to other kind of troops such as hussars or even infantry."
 steppe_raiders: "Steppe Raiders"
 steppe_raidersDESCR: "While they would make an early entry firearms where slow to make a big difference on the steppes due to the mobile nature of warfare. Cavalry would continue to be the dominant arm for the steppe armies throughout the early modern era before firearms would be made lighter and more accurate. Knives and swords would long remain the weapon of choice in close combat for Steppe Infantry."
 steppe_footmen: "Steppe Footmen"
 steppe_footmenDESCR: "The mobile nature of steppe warfare always meant that infantry would be at a disadvantage to cavalry in terms of mobility and in the great open landscapes this meant that many sedentary infantry tactics would be far less viable in the plains. In order to counter this steppe infantry would frequently form wagon forts in battle, which allowed them a protected mobility on the battlefield. Protected by the wagon forts infantry could make use of fire arms and bows while still remaining safe from cavalry attacks."
 steppe_musketeers: "Steppe Musketeers"
 steppe_musketeersDESCR: "To be effective on the Steppes infantry continued to create mobile forts on the battlefields from which lighter muskets and cannon could be brought to bear on the enemy without the risk of cavalry shocks from the lighter steppe cavalry breaking their formations. Lightly armed soldiers would also raid deeper into enemy lands using boats along the great rivers of the plains."
 steppe_infantry: "Steppe Infantry"
 steppe_infantryDESCR: "With cannons and fire arms getting lighter and more accurate the Steppe wagon forts could be used more offensively. The entire fort would move in unison to defensive positions from which they could unleash a hail of musket and cannon fire. As the battle developed cavalry was then be unleashed from within the fort on the fleeing enemy. The cannons used where of small of calibre that they could be brought on horseback with the host as it moved over the Steppes."
 steppe_rifles: "Steppe Rifles"
 steppe_riflesDESCR: "While the basics of steppe warfare did not change the general evolution of warfare would in time lead to a number of developments to the armies of the hosts. As sedentary powers pushed back the borders of the free Steppes, fortifying formerly nomadic areas and creating their own regiments of Cossacks, Tartars, and the like the Steppe countries themselves would often come to be dominated by and adapt the better weapons and more organized ideas of their neighbors."
 reformed_steppe_rifles: "Reformed Steppe Rifles"
 reformed_steppe_riflesDESCR: "By the end of the 18th century steppe armies had in many ways gone through similar transitions as militaries to the west. While warfare would remain more mobile than in sedentary regions equipment and organization evolved to be more like standing armies. Mobility and the reliance on old tactics such as raiding and surprise attacks using boats would, however, continue to be employed regularly into the 19th century."
 muscovite_caracolleDESCR: "With the discovery that a tightly formed infantry could withstand cavalry shock action, and that the use of gunpowder weapons would inflict a fearful toll on the attacker, new cavalry tactics were required. One of the first of these was the Caracole (or spiral) where cavalry would use fire to disrupt infantry formations before attempting a charge. Developed in the West in the 16th century it quickly spread eastwards."
 muscovite_cossackDESCR: "Cossack cavalry steadily evolved as time progressed. Rather than being a shock cavalry force like the new heavier Hussars they specialized in skirmishing and would use pistols to disorganize the enemy."
 muscovite_musketeerDESCR: "With the large scale use of gunpowder weapons on the Eastern European battlefields new units began to be developed to take advantage of these. Having its origins in the Streltsy of Muscovy these units evolved into Musket armed units that placed their main focus on the attack rather than defense."
 muscovite_soldatyDESCR: "The introduction of the Tercio into Eastern European warfare was met by those who saw the tercio as being too defensive and who believed that infantry should be employed more offensively. The Soldaty Infantry filled this role."

 persian_footsoldierDESCR: "Low ranking foot soldier usually armed with a sword."
 persian_rifleDESCR: "During the Qajar era, the Persian army went through extensive westernizing reforms. With the help of foreign advisors, the troops were trained in western military strategies and technologies."

 peruvian_guerilla_warfareDESCR: "The South American Guerrilla is a tough opponent. Although they do not do a lot of damage to the opposition, it can take a long time to wear down these units."
 polish_hussarDESCR: "The original Hussar was a light cavalry unit designed primarily for skirmishing. However, the battlefield demanded that units be better armored and heavier. Thus the Hussar evolved leading eventually to the famous Winged Hussars."
 polish_musketeerDESCR: "With the growing spread of gunpowder weapons, soon the question of what musket armed infantry should do on the battlefield was raised. In Poland, there developed a school of thought that musketeers should be used as a defensive weapon to support cavalry."
 polish_tercioDESCR: "Although the tercio came to dominate European battlefields it was initially too slow to be of use on the more open, cavalry dominated battlefields of Eastern Europe. However as the pike component of the tercio fell, giving it more firepower, it became more useful on the eastern battlefields."
 polish_winged_hussarDESCR: "In medieval times, mounted knights had dominated the medieval battlefield but afterwards were replaced by musketeers and pikemen. In the 17th century, cavalry forces were still used for a surprise effect in battles, but had often little chance against disciplined pikemen. Therefore, cavalry forces were little used in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe with its vast steppes, cavalry remained very important. The winged Hussars played a key role there. The Polish developed an excellent curved saber (the 'palasz'), selected horses specially for their speed and endurance and they carried lances with them, of six meters, that could pierce a pikemen's armor. The winged Hussars became a heavily armored cavalry that fought countless victorious actions against a variety of enemies. They played a key role in John Sobieski's legendary lifting of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. John Sobieski sent four Hussar cavalry groups in a furious charge that broke the Turkish battle line, scattering them in confusion. This victory by the winged Polish Hussars saw John Sobieski hailed as the 'savior of Vienna'."
 prussian_uhlanDESCR: "The first Uhlans were created in the early 18th Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more the Heavily Armored Cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on in the 18th Century they became an essential part of the military's structure due to their light armor making them fast and agile on the battlefield and for their high shock value against their enemies, which in some cases turned the tide in Battles. The Uhlans were a good alternative to large Infantry Armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller Nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 prussian_drillDESCR: "Drilled Soldiers were soldiers that had been vigorously trained, so that they would know exactly what to do in a battle situation. They were also less likely to break ranks whilst fighting against the enemy. An example would be the Prussian Drilled Soldiers. They were among the world's best trained and equipped soldiers at the time. They were very disciplined and well trained for nearly any situation. So good was their reputation that the American Colonies had asked for Prussian drill instructors to be sent to train the colonists so they could fight against the British."
 pueblo_ambushDESCR: "In the broken terrain in the foothills of the Rockies, new tactics built around ambush began to develop. These units did not have the staying power of the mountain infantry but they did hurt the enemies' morale with their ambush tactics."
 qizilbash_cavalry_unitDESCR: "Cavalry units, armed with spear, sword or bow easily recognized by their red and gold striped headgear, worn to express their devotion to the Twelver division of Shia Islam."
 reformed_asian_cavalryDESCR: "Westernized Asian cavalry more adapted to Western tactics and strategies."
 reformed_asian_musketeerDESCR: "Westernized Asian infantry equipped with muskets and more adapted to Western tactics and strategies."
 reformed_manchu_rifleDESCR: "An army developed under the Qing dynasty after the Manchu conquest of China. The army made up the main bulk in military operations and consisted mostly of Chinese Han soldiers."
 royal_mortarDESCR: "During the 18th century the use of artillery on the battlefield became more widespread. The troops were now able to move their field guns with much more ease and speed."
 defensive_royal_mortarDESCR: "During the 18th century the use of artillery on the battlefield became more widespread. The troops were now able to move their field guns with much more ease and speed."
 russian_cossackDESCR: "Cossacks remained an integral part of Eastern European armies. Although neither as disciplined nor as effective in the charge as the heavy cavalry. These light units specialized in raiding and sniping to disrupt their opponents."
 russian_cuirassierDESCR: "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."
 russian_massDESCR: "Mass Infantry tactics were a departure from the linear tactics that had been dominant for so long. These units can be summed up in two of the maxims of the famous Russian general Suvorov 'train hard, fight easy' and 'The bullet is a fool, the bayonet is a fine chap'. They were highly drilled shock infantry who favored the mass charge over musket fire."
 russian_green_coatDESCR: "As more ideas were imported from Western Europe, the Eastern infantry man became much more like his Western European counterpart. The Green Coat infantry had its origins in Russia and its western training methods and equipment gave their units with more staying power in combat than ever before. It also represented a shift from the Petrine defense tactics to a more offensive unit."
 russian_lancerDESCR: "The Hussars of Eastern Europe had long been equipped with a lance along with other equipment. The lance was a power weapon in the attack, allowing a trooper to reach his enemy before the enemy could reach him, however, once the enemy managed to get passed the lance the lancer was vulnerable. Lance equipped cavalry were very strong in the attack but weak defensively."
 russian_petrineDESCR: "Petrine Infantry have their roots in the defeat of the Russian Armies at the battle of Narva during the Great Northern War. The army had been decisively routed by the better trained, but numerically inferior, Swedish Army and the army needed new tactics if it was to succeed. Trained with iron discipline, the Petrine Infantry excelled in defense. Their tactics were built around wearing down the enemys' ability to fight through sheer staying power."
 saxon_infantryDESCR: "August the Strong, Elector of Saxony, was not just famous for siring more bastards than any other European Monarch, he was also King of Poland. During his reign he brought more offensive infantry tactics to the Polish military, and the units became known as Saxon Infantry."
 scottish_highlanderDESCR: "The Highland Infantry divisions which make up such a recognizable force in many of today's Commonwealth armies have their roots in the semi-feudal clan system of north and west Scotland. Scottish Highlanders were lightly armored clansmen, often equipped with the traditional Scottish basket-hilted sword, the claymore, as well as small knives, known as dirks. Later Highland soldiers also carried pistols. They were feared for the ferocity of their attack, particularly the famous Highland Charge, used to smash through enemy lines. Following the Jacobite rebellions, the Scottish Highlanders were gradually assimilated into the British Army. The first such Highland troops were the Black Watch, or 42nd Highland Regiment of Foot, who fought valiantly at Fontenoy during the War of Austrian Succession. The Highland Regiments subsequently became a feared fighting force, noted in particular for bravery and a refusal to surrender."
 shaybaniDESCR: "A cavalry unit most often relying on indirect military tactics, harassing and raiding its enemies."
 slavic_stradiotiDESCR: "The Stratioti developed in the Albanian-Greek areas of the Balkans. With little or no armor, they were armed with sabers, lances and maces. This light cavalry was excellent for screening, reconnaissance and for raiding into disarrayed or fleeing enemies. With the fall of Byzantium many sought refuge in the west, and the Venetian Stratioti cavalry of the late 15th century is believed by some to have introduced modern light cavalry tactics to the west."
 small_cast_iron_bombardDESCR: "An early form of European artillery used for both sieges and defense. The Bombard was a simple cannon able to hurl projectiles at enemy defenses. The missile of choice was often a metal ball or large stone, intended to cause damage to fortifications rather than enemy personnel. Even the smaller Bombards were heavy and difficult to move quickly during battle, limiting their use against infantry and cavalry formations."
 songhai_tribal_warfareDESCR: "A traditional West African tribal warrior armed with a spear and a characteristic shield excelling in defensive strategies."
 south_american_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "With the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, gunpowder weapons came to be known by the local population. The advantages became apparent and it was only a matter of time before units appeared carrying muskets. The Defensive musketeer was the descendant of the mountain warriors, following a similar pattern of organization and focus but now armed with a musket. This unit is strongest in defense, but the new gunpowder weapons give it extra punch in attack."
 south_american_spearmenDESCR: "The basic unit of armies of South Americas. They were usually a peasant levy led by aristocratic officers and armed with spear and shield. This unit formed the backbone of the armies of states like the Inca Empire."
 south_american_warfareDESCR: "The high mountains of the Andes created an environment which was far superior for defense rather than attack. There was a gradual evolution were infantry began to specialize in defense and staying power over attack."
 spanish_tercioDESCR: "Tercio infantry was developed principally by the brilliant general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (El Gran Capitán), during the Italian Wars. It was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Tercio formations, with their disciplined and spirited professional soldiers, were famed on the European battlefield for their nearly invincible manner in combat during the 16th and 17th centuries. Their domination of the European battlefields came to a definite end with the Spanish defeat by the French at the battle of Rocroi in 1643. A new fighting system, promoted by Gustavus Adolphus, would take over from then on."
 swedish_arme_blancheDESCR: "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock, and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, the arme blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 swedish_carolineDESCR: "The military reforms of the Swedish king Charles XI created a new force of infantry, specializing in the attack. Devastating volleys of musket rounds would be the prelude to a mass charge."
 swedish_gallopDESCR: "The pistol armed Caracole Cavalry came to dominate European cavalry tactics in Eastern Europe, although the traditional shock action cavalry style of the Hussars was still in use. Armies trained in the Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against these units. Borne out of the bloodshed of the Polish Wars, the Swedish army developed a different kind of unit, the Swedish Gallop Cavalry. Although still armed with pistols like the caracole they did not discharge their pistols before the shock action but as a part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Thirty Years' War, forcing the Imperial Caracole cavalry to adapt very quickly."
 swedish_gustavianDESCR: "In the early 17th century the musket had a loading time that was still very slow and musket fire needed to be concentrated in volleys to be destructive, as the weapons were very inaccurate and misfires were common. Such a slow reloading time meant that the unit would be very vulnerable if all the guns were fired simultaneously. Since the days of Maurice of Nassau this problem was overcome by arranging the unit in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. Gustavus Adolphus, the great Swedish king, significantly improved this Maurician infantry tactic. He trained his troops so well that he was able to reduce the number of ranks to only three (one kneeling, the second crouching and, the third standing) and yet still maintain continuous fire."
 swiss_landsknechtenDESCR: "Landsknechte were a type of infantry first created in the early 16th century in the Holy Roman Empire. They were mostly armed with a long spear or pike. George von Frundsberg is considered to be the creator of the Landsknechte. The Landsknechte fought mostly in a square type formation called the Pike Square. They were also famous for the elaborate clothing they wore on the battlefield."
 swivel_cannonDESCR: "A highly maneuverable and portable cannon. The Swivel gun was rather small and designed primarily for short range warfare."
 defensive_swivel_cannonDESCR: "A highly maneuverable and portable cannon. The Swivel gun was rather small and designed primarily for short range warfare."
 tartar_cossackDESCR: "The Cossack continued to evolve as a unit. The use of new weapons and tactics gave the units greater staying power in fire combat and more shock power."
 threedeckerDESCR: "A large battleship equipped with three gun decks, usually holding more than a 100 cannons."
 tofongchis_musketeerDESCR: "Despite initial reluctance, muskets gradually became more commonly accepted during the late 16th century. The advantage of firearms had become undeniable and muskets slowly found their way into the Muslim infantry forces."
 topchis_artilleryDESCR: "Muslim cavalry unit armed with a matchlock musket."
 twodeckerDESCR: "A two-decked battleship normally equipped with 60 to 90 guns."
 wargalleonDESCR: "The war galleon was a large galleon outfitted for war. It was larger and more heavily armed than the regular galleons, and served as protecting escorts to galleon fleets. The Spanish treasure fleets were made out of galleons and war galleons."
 westernized_adalDESCR: "East African warriors. Somewhat influenced by Western military defense tactics."
 westernized_aztecDESCR: "With the introduction of western training methods and new equipment, the hill warrior became a much more effective fighting man. The new training methods gave the unit much more cohesion in combat, while the new equipment improved the unit's abilities in both attack and defense. The hill warrior remained, however, a mainly defensive unit."
 westernized_bantuDESCR: "South African warriors influenced by Western military offense tactics and strategies."
 westernized_ethiopianDESCR: "North African warriors influenced by Western military defense tactics and strategies."
 westernized_mayanDESCR: "As western military ideas were spread, even the forest warrior in the Americas was not immune to change. The new training techniques improved this unit's ability to withstand fire in combat."
 westernized_niger_kongoleseDESCR: "Central African warriors influenced by Western military defense and offense tactics."
 westernized_south_americanDESCR: "The Westernized South American infantry were the successors of the mountain warriors of earlier eras. Western training and equipment has improved these units in all departments, but their focus remains defensive."
 westernized_zapotecDESCR: "The new military tactics of Europe were slowly spreading across the Americas. The new training methods strengthened the cohesion of the plains warrior, while the new equipment increased the effectiveness of the unit in all areas of combat."
 western_longbowDESCR: "The longbow was a missile weapon mostly used by infantry from England and Wales from the 14th to the 16th century. The weapon was very accurate and had a long range and was powerful enough to penetrate chain-mail armor. The English used this weapon with great success in the Hundred Years War against France, never more so than at the battles of Crécy and Agincourt. With the development of gunpowder, the longbow became obsolete. This was not because it was less powerful than the early muskets but because to become a good longbow-man, you had to train for many years, while training people to use fire-arms was much easier."
 western_medieval_infantryDESCR: "The basic soldier of Western European armies. They tended to be peasant levies with little or no training and very poor equipment. However when deployed en masse they could be devastating."
 western_medieval_knightsDESCR: "The medieval Knight originated in the Frankish kingdoms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Western Europe and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which Knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 western_men_at_armsDESCR: "The Man at Arms was a professional soldier in Western European armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier. During the Hundred Years War, Men at Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants at Arms."
 zapotec_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "Even the plains warrior with his emphasis on bravery in attack, could not ignore the benefits of the musket brought from Europe. The new offensive musketeers still retained their attack emphasis, but the gunpowder weapons gave them additional firepower."
 zapotec_plains_warfareDESCR: "The plains warrior was the ultimate offensive unit in the Americas, but even they were not immune to progress. New weapons and tactics allowed the units to improve their offensive capability, while new training methods helped these warriors to maintain morale in combat."
 zapotec_tribal_warfareDESCR: "The area of the Zapotec empire created conditions highly suitable for offensive warfare. Here military units were developed that specialized in attack and used tactics designed to undermine the morale of their opponents."
 zaporoghian_cossackDESCR: "The Cossacks community originally grew up on the steppe boundary between Muscovy and Poland on one side and the Tatars on the other. In this savage environment of constant raiding, military communities of horsemen developed. They soon became in demand as hardy, if undisciplined, horsemen."
 zulu_chest_and_hornsDESCR: "An African military strategy developed by the African chief Shaka during the 18th century. The warriors would surround their enemy by positioning smaller groups of warriors on the left and right flank, representing the horns of a buffalo, and a larger group would be positioned in the middle, representing the chest."

 ha_xantican_warriorDESCR: "Our new 'Firearm' has taken its name from Xantico, Goddess of fire and volcanoes. Armed with Xantis, our warriors are more effective than ever."
 ha_reformed_xantican_warriorDESCR: "Experience with Xantis has led us to the conclusion that a greater weight of fire could be achieved by having multiple rows of Xanti Warriors who fire their weapons and then step to the rear, allowing the next rank to fire while the previous rank reloads."
 ha_xiuhtecuhtli_soldierDESCR: "Xiuhtecuhtli, Lord of Volcanoes, is the namesake of our larger and more powerful Firearms. With both greater range and striking power, it is far more deadly than the Xanti."
 ha_xiuhtecuhtlian_infantryDESCR: "Trained to better use the range of the Xiuhtecuhtli, Xiuhtecuhtlian Infantry are masters of ranged warfare."
 ha_xolotiDESCR: "A revolution in Firearms design has taken place. Unlike older designs, which used a lit slowmatch to fire, the Xoloti uses a mechanical striker holding a lump of Obsidian to strike a spark which fires the weapon. Faster to reload and less prone to misfires, it is no surprise that this weapon takes its name from Xolotl, Lord of Lightning and Death."
 ha_foreign_influenced_infantryDESCR: "While the Aztec invention of Firearms changed warfare forever, they are now widely used around the world by many nations. By studying the tactics and strengths of other nations and incorporating the best parts into our own armed forces it should be possible to surpass them all."
 ha_reformed_influenced_infantryDESCR: "Further contact and experiments with foreign armed forces have led us to the conclusion that our army has been overly concerned with offensive fire. Future training will place more emphasis on quickly transitioning between spread out formations which can avoid ranged fire and dense formations which can engage in melee combat when needed."
 ha_reformed_xolotiDESCR: "The tactics of the Reformed Xoloti are a perfect blend of home-grown and foreign ideals, greater than the sum of their parts. While massed Xoloti fire is still their preferred tactic, melee combat holds no fear for them either."
 high_american_horsemenDESCR: "The arrival of horses following contact with Europe has led to a limited adoption of their use in warfare."

 high_american_hussarDESCR: "Light cavalry specializing in raiding and hit-and-run tactics."
 high_american_swarmDESCR: "Swarm cavalry are loose order cavalry armed with light Xoloti which use harassing fire tactics to disorder the enemy before charging. Their loose order makes them less vulnerable to fire from the enemy."
